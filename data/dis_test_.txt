Simply put, I do not see any way that a "Platonic essence" could have any *real* existance.  "Essence" in the Platonic sense does not have any referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in other ways. So, to attribute an 'essence' to God is to attribute to him something that does not exist!!  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave the unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence', thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address. Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one. --    or [I think one can read Augustine as saying something consistent with your comments.

In the EC, the Corrado VR6 is rated as 'best handling car this side of a  968'. As it goes, I just read an article in 'Autocar & Motor' comparing the  VR6 to a Ford Probe (later to be launched in the UK).... The VR6 is more powerful (even more so coz its 2.9 instead of 2.8 in the EC) and more fun to drive etc etc... but the Probe has a slightly smoother engine (thanx Mazda MX6!)... They sum it up as 'both cars are fast - the VR6 is a bit more exhilirating to  drive but only if you're prepared to work harder'  							....Shaz....

John Fife, visited our church about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--it's been a busy week for our small church!!).  He was asked specifically about the issue of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next month.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range the gamut from "outlawing" homosexuality altogether to "legalizing" it completely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult issue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Without question, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunited for all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and is pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion issue last year as a solution. He is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the members of the church "Agree to Disagree" on the issue, admitting that both sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead them to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortion issue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that the GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree with their own view. -- Cliff Slaughterbeck           |  Dept. of Physics, FM-15       |   It's time for the sermon on the University of Washington      |   Grand Torino! Seattle, WA 98195             | [It's going to be hard to agree to disagree.  If we allow disagreement, then some presbyteries and churches are going to ordain people that others will not recognize.  That's a difficult situation in a connectional church.  I could live with it, but I think a lot of people would not be willing to.  Note that the church was not willing to live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women.  The one thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming a Presbyterian minister is if they indicate that they don't accept ordination of women.  The argument is that we can't have half the church not accepting the leaders of the other half.  Maybe people will decide to live with it in this case when they didn't in the other, but I wonder.  I admit that my own Presbytery submitted an overture to the GA that would have exactly this effect, and we considered the ambiguity better than the current situation.  --clh]

It assumes that >if the Bible doesn't say specifically that you don't need to do something, >then that must mean that you do need to do it.

However, if it >were sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; If the Bible >doesn't specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be OK, >which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question I've often pondered.    This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is _not_ in the Bible, then it _must not_ be done.  But I don't really think that's what he's saying anyway.  See below. >If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyone >else in this group does too?), why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostles >speak out against it? Owning slaves was common practice back then. Paul >speaks about everything else that is immoral. He apparently thought it >was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. Why >doesn't anyone mention slavery? If God's morals are eternal and don't >change like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral then >as it is today.    What about the letter to Philemon?  In it Paul at least hints that a certain slave be released.  Also, slavery in those times was not the same as the type of slavery we had in the U.S.  I think a better comparison would be to indentured servitude.  I don't really want to get into a discussion on slavery.  Anyway, although it does demonstrate your point, I don't think it is relevent, because the original poster did not say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not immoral.    Back to the original poster's assertion.  He is not in fact making the logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the Bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that the Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven. _Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the contrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the Bible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what it says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so we baptize infants.    To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something is not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if something cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be asserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_, using the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are theories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually proving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling into is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is false.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.    I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use Scripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism, although the evidence seems to me to favor it. -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University

So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents. >> What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths? > >The difference is that a rational person would address the leading >cause _first_, and address the lesser causes later. >  That thinking is so screwed up, I don't even know how to respond to it. A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.???????????????? So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease, chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes.  Oh, okay Charles, that makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes. Please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.   I've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents group or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't confuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree. I'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it.     >> I assumed that any humane >> person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents >> gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. > >A "humane person" who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old >would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm; >Ignorance is our greatest enemy. >  Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined as "a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths."  If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I am inhumane and irrational.   >>  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence >                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >What _other_ sources of information do you have which confirms their >data?  These folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts. >Perhaps you can verify their data with the Uniform Crime Report... > Sorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting the facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, "Firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990"   Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state that "Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded".   Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say "Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990."   Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state that "Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from 1986 to 1988."   Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion.

As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot, whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and whether they themselves have ever been shot.

Hey man! - Having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a couple of sessions of mock hockey, I'm ready to invest in hockey equipment (particularly since I will be taking summer 'hockey lessons').  However, I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it comes to hockey equipment.  I've checked out local stores and looked at catalogs, but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before actually plunking down any money.  Having played football in high school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for comparison.  But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to different kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  Are there any notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  So any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.

The Waco Quiz What would you do in the following hypothetical situations? You have committed no crime.  The BATF conducts a "no-knock" raid. a) Hands in air. Say "Do you have a warrant?" Think of hefty suit settlement. b) Say "You have 1 second to identify yourself as a cop or I shoot." c) Shoot.  Heck, at least in federal prison you might get to have sex. You have killed federal agents. They blast strange music at you. a) Come out with hands up. "I wish to turn state's evidence." Hope deal's good. b) Wait, figuring other federal agents will get bored and go on vacation. c) Wait. If they come after you there will be a chance to kill MORE g-men. The FBI has you surrounded, asks you to come out immediately. a) Come out, figuring long prison term is chance to catch up on some writing. b) Stall.

If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due to the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate. In fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of meat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up such scenes.  As such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from a magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the time of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for the evidence.

Considering the magnitude of loss of life in both the Moro Castle and Titanic disasters,  I can't believe you can be so blithe there fred. Besides if a LNG tanker breaks up in a close harbor, you can kiss off quite a lot of population.  same thing for any chemical tankers. I know the coast guard makes  mandatory safety equipment checks on all watercraft.  they use this as an excuse to make narcotics  searches, without warrants. I suspect, that  commercial craft need a certificate at least similiar in scope to an air worthiness certificate from the DOT. pat

Using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesn't give me a lot of confidence in your call either.  Next time consider getting a second opinion from a clueful observer.

Are you sure you want to include Chalcedon here?  I presume that you  mean the description of Jesus as fully human and fully devine.  Almost  everyone would consider the majority of Copts and Armenians, and the  Jacobites, as Christians, yet for 15 centuries it has been maintained  that they disagree with the Formula of Chalcedon.  Those that wouldn't  consider them Christians are most likely to object that these communities  don't require a personal commitment to Jesus, which is only tangentially  related to the Formula of Chalcedon.   --  [As I understand the recent discussion here, the Copts for all practical purposes accept Chalcedon.  They talk about one nature rather than two, but the issue seems to be one of terminology rather than substance.  --clh]

I've seen children do this and wondered about something.  If the mucus in one's nose collects (filters) particles going into the airway, if a child then picks and ingests this material, might it have a vaccinatory effect, since if the body ingests airborne diseases or other 'stuff' on the mucus, the body might generate antibodies for this small "invasion"?

Hi! This is my first time to post on this news group. Now a days , I have stucked at a certain problem. I have '88 mazda mx-6, non  turbo fuel injection.    There is a engine warning signal on the dash board. While driving, this signal turns on, but not always. What does this mean? In the manual, they say "Go to authorized mazda dealer.". It is really good idea. Don't you think so?    I wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. Is anybody out there who can give me same advice as "authorized mazda dealer" can give ? Youjip Won

I often turn my stereo off and just run it towards red line on nice twisty roads. But Toyota engines at idle have a strange "bells and whisstles at the bottom of a matal can" sound.

> >As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like >the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use >it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor >has an ulcer. Julie, it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it (MSG or something else for that matter) simply because you are not allergic to it. For example you might not be allergic to (animal) fats, and like their taste, yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them (regularly). MSG might have other bad (or good, I am not up on  knowledge of MSG) effects on your body in the long run, maybe that's reason enough not to use it.  Altho' your example of the ulcer is funny, it isn't an appropriate comparison at all. -Prakash Das
>It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control >available in industry today were derived from Government projects. >GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes >from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry Of course, 	How many government projects after Using PERT, GANT, C.P.M.s Process flow diagrams,  Level 5 software projects....  actually come in on schedule and under Cost.  I know the GAO determined that 80% of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing to adequately measure  engineering developement costs.    Me, I am allin favor of Government R&D.  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best  to do research.   I don't think the government should pour money into any one sector,  but should engage in projects which naturally push the state of the art.   THings like  High tech  construction projects,  apollo  was worth it for the doing.  Running hte national labs.  The SSC is grossly overweight,  but is a reasonable project at a lower cost.   Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected. Maybe what they should do, is throw out much of the process and just tell new PH'ds,  you get a 1 time grant of $50,000.00   If you produce, you can  qualify for other grants.  If you don't  you never get in again. THis way  young people get a shot at  reserach,  and older  stale  scientists don't dominate the process. pat

You're a sorry Hmm... all reports from Texas authorities indicate that none of the children which the group released showed any signs of child abuse.. given that the same results were found the last time the group was investigated for such allegations, I can pretty much state that I strongly suspect the government of disinformation /deception on this issue.  And about stockpiling weapons/food, many recognized religous groups practice maintaining a one years supply of food, and some even maintain a supply of weapons and ammunition, why are those two facts grounds  for an armed assault?  And from the dollar value of the weapons purchased,  if they bought decent firearms it comes out to about one handgun, rifle, and shotgun for each adult, with a few extras...

These are MY last words on the subject > As a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are > too, I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE FOOD INDUSTRY WANTS TO PUT MSG IN FOOD!!! Some people think it enhances the flavor.  I personally don't think it helps the taste, it makes me sick, so I try to avoid it. > Sez you.

Well, I know that MSG effects ME adversely - maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that I like to try to avoid the stuff. > If you don't like additives, then for godsake,  > get off the net and learn to cook from scratch.  Sheesh. EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!! Why can't people learn to cook from scratch *ON* the net.  I've gotten LOTS of recipes off the net that don't use additives. If you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket, buy lots of packaged foods, and YOU get OFF THE NET!! > >IS IT TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT THE RECIPES ARE NOT VERY GOOD  > >OR THE FOOD IS POOR QUALITY? >  > Yes, and YOU buy it.

HEY - I'll pay *MY* hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does NOT have preservatives.  I choose to speak with my pocketbook in many ways. > You have a good point.

Nacho cheese Doritos, breading for MANY frozen fried foods (like fish and chicken), etc. ad naseum. > If MSG is really the problem, we should call this "barbecue potato > chip syndrome" or maybe "diner syndrome."    Or the "and other natural flavorings syndrome."  It's been a few years since I've bought anything labelled with "and other natural flavorings".   > >THE REACTION CAME THE TIME THE MSG WAS IN THE FOOD > >THAT WAS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE > >SAME RESTAURANT - SAME INGREDIENTS!!! >  > How do you know this? >  > In order to demonstrate your claim, you would have had to supervise the > preparation on both occasions.

Well, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in there - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE I'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY different products with MSG that I figured out one thing. UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels. > PLEASE note that I am NOT saying you are making it up, I am just > trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it > might seem.   Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products. And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge) - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg - and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple explanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so I can either throw it out or give it away.) > My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG,  Probably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.   I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  I've noticed that I have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the Chinese restaurants the day before.   > > > All that's needed now is that final step, a double-blind study done > on humans.  There isn't even an ethical question about "possible > harm", as this is a widely used and approved food additive. But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG - some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test. Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the reaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ chips ;}). > Because too many of you (generic rhetorical 'you,' not 'you Cathy') go > around calling this "Chinese restaurant syndrome," thus suggesting to the > people you complain to that you experience this ONLY from Chinese food.  > MSG is prevalent in a LOT more things than Chinese food--thats why I > suggested calling this "Diner syndrome."   Cathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it "chinese restaurant syndrome" and I NEVER stated I got it only from Chinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or not hold) the MSG.  I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them to make me ONE back of chips without MSG. > On the other hand, if one complains about potatoes from a mix, or > restaurant spice mixes, I'm going to believe them, and if anyone says they > got (MSG-)sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party, I'm > REALLY going to believe them.   Well, I believe I mentioned that in an earlier post  Let's see you wrote this message at but on  I wrote: > >Has anyone had an MSG reaction from something *other than* a > >Chinese restaurant?   > LOTS of times - that's why it was so hard for me to pin down.

> >If the Oilers move to Hamilton what division will they play in . And won't they have to change their name to the "Steelers" or something. The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by the tire fire a  few years back. Then again if the NBA can have the Utah Jazz or the L.A. Lakers (think about it, what lakes are in L.A.) then I guess the NHL can have the Hamilton Oilers.

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes. Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced "European" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on. --  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------           I stand by all the misstatements that I've made. 		-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89

Paul- 	You did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to  offend us Catholics; hopefully I can be just as careful in my wording as you were. 	I also don't want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of debate (anymore than it already is), but just a note or two: 	1.  Please don't talk about Jesus' "parents"--the doctrinal positions 		of the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and 		Joseph.  I (personally) have never heard of anything being 		attributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is, 		no reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven, 		immaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to 		Mary. 	2.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our 		doctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a  		significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only 		source of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred  		traditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no 		problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a 		unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early  		generation that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul, 		etc. etc.  It wasn't until the reformation that these doctrines 		were called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, my 		personaly feelings) if it's a choice between the apostles or 		Luther, I'll choose the apostles every time, whether or not 		it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men 		have determined to be "the bible". 	Like a said, just a couple of notes.  As is often said, I believe that we must agree to (politely) disagree.   	May God's peace and blessings be with you always in your search to discover His absolute truth.   			- Mike Walker 			  (Univ. of Illinois)
> i heard a news report indicating research showing improved          > hearing in people taking vitamin A. the research showed that new     > growth replaced damaged "hairlike" nerves. has anyone heard about > this?  >  Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A( retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by  high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).  The  types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells  and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing  process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond  to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't  know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are  capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major  breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin  A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using  vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go  on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on  your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done,  more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing  loss if there really is one. Marty B.

Many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably don't hate the people.  I don't.  I don't hate my kids when they do wrong either.  But I tell them what is right, and if they lie or don't admit they are wrong, or just don't make an effort to improve or repent, they get punished.  I think this is quite appropriate.  You may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here. Maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through feel goodism.  Maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more than God.  Kind of like the Adam and Eve story.  Read it and compare it to today's mentality.  You may be suprised.
>I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly, >THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in >Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or >were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever >owned the arena doing some price gouging? Norman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team.  When he bought the team, it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red, before the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impression that he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit, but this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket prices.  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move.  He was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the other two arenas in town, etc. Oh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$.  Green wanted immediate huge returns in Dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN.  Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel Minnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down there as well.  All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL team for a year or two.  Too bad for the NHL. KEA

See the rec.pets.cats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information. I am not any of the above, but we do have a couple of cats. It is transmitted through the fecal matter, so a pregnant woman should avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before preparing or eating meals.  The latter is sound advice at any time of course. Apart from that, its no great problem.  You certainly do not need to get rid of your cats.

By     the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas,     the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round    trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as    5000 kg in a Low Earth "advertising" orbit: Very roughly the    same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were    to become common place, that would have to be a very low price... This is nonsense.  Its like saying that by the time commercials on television become commonplace every citizen will have their own hour long nationally broadcast TV program.    There's always been a problem of having to get     away from civilization before you can really find "natural"    scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip    of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles    or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards    on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still    "wild." While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital    billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of     growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will    not save your view of the night sky, because by the time     such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble    finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_    the stars... The rest of your post is strange mishmash of "its already really bad" and "it doesn't really matter if it gets worse."  You should try to figure out what you are really arguing for.

If they don't do a  reboost this time, they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing mission.  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the  back and you could have problems.

Just to add another bad vibe, they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument.  Finally,  this is a chance for NASA astronanuts to prove they could build and service a space station.  Hubble was designed for in flight servicing. bringing the telescope down, to my understanding, was considered even very recently, but all these factors contribute to the  decision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning. |> Gruss, |> Dr Bruce Scott                             The deadliest bullshit is |> Max-Planck-Institut fuer Plasmaphysik       odorless and transparent |> bds at spl6n1.aug.ipp-garching.mpg.de                 -- W Gibson ROB --  =========================================================================== | Rob Douglas                     | SPACE     | 3700 San Martin Drive     | | AI Software Engineer            | TELESCOPE | Baltimore, MD  21218, USA | | Advance Planning Systems Branch | SCIENCE   | Phone: (410) 338-4497     | =========================================================================== Disclaimer-type-thingie>>>>>  These opinions are mine!

: I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where : Christians were called to "repent" of America's "national" sins, such : as sexual promiscuity. :  : To which I reply: ...whoa there! :  : How can I repent of _someone else's_ sin?   I can't. :  : And when I claim to "repent" of someone else's sin, am I not in fact : _judging_ him?  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us : not to judge people. "Judge not that ye be not judged." :  : C. S. Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II, : when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging "national repentance" : for the horrors (sins???) of World War II. : --  I see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree. To repent means to turn around.  We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly arrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to participate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We have arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed us the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other nations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have stricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of the honor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public as our sins have been. When Jesus said "Judge not that ye be not judged", he was not addressing those like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to repent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down condemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  But He also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a command too. Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the excuse that we don't want to judge anyone. In truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin what it is and do so openly.  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should. But instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their hellward path and onto the heavenward path. -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 	"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...

The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G. type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph, and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows. The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess... (The title was the only thing they changed/added) "Gun Stats" The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley, author of "Armed and Female."  The article, in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The article states, "A study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder."  This is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons, outlined below: The study gives the impression that, if you own a  gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to  defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you.  The study, however, fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun  to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe- trator. The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every month, the second your grandmother cashes her social security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a friend. The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample  size (396), taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be  used, successfully, by a private citizen against an  aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a  gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means, or who offer no resistance at all. Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies  also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can  be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. D.F.

I don't know about where you are, but here in California false representation of odometer readings is a criminal felony. If you can substantiate this, you need to report that dealer to the local authorities. You should consult with a lawyer to tell you what civil action you can take as well. Keep in mind that you will have to prove that the dealer was aware of the change in the dashboard. Brian Donnell

All I said was that a right is whatever you or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn't come into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly, the people); from that point it defined legal rights.  "Common law" rights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on a Bill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they demanded from the government.  Legitimate or illegitimate, power is power.  That's why the federal government can force states to grant their citizens rights they don't wish to: In a slugging match, the feds win.  Period.    And you're right, this doesn't belong in sci.space.  I've said my peace.  No more frome me on rights (at least not here). >Most gracious regards,  >WHH  Doug Loss

His job is to set basic policies and manage the people under him.  If Clinton instructed Reno to preserve lives, and if she confirmed that the plan for the raid was a safe as could be, then he did his job.  The President should not involve himself in the minor details of these kinds of operations.  This sort of micromanagement only leads to disaster, as was demonstrated so well in Vietnam. But the raid went bad:  Over 80 civilians have been killed in a controntation with U.S. authorities. NOW Clinton enters the picture in a big way.  Will Clinton start an investigation?  Or will he try to squash any attempt to investigate? Is he a responsible leader?  Or is he only interested in protecting the image of his administration? We'll all find out as this unfolds. --  ----------------+ Academic Computing, Illinois Institute of Technology +1 312 567 5962 | 10 W. 31st Street, Chicago, Illinois  60616

I got this recipe from a watier on the greek island of samos. They use it as a spread for bread there butit is excellent on gyro's as well. By the way, the actual name is tzatziki. Here is the recipe: yoghurt, chopped garlic, peeled chopped cucumber, salt, white pepper, a little olive oil and a little vinegar.

My brother works at a dialysis clinic.  They were interviewing  candidates for a technician job (mainly electronics tech), and a urine screen was part of the interview.  The bathroom was across the hall from a lab.  One candidate managed to switch his urine sample with one he grabbed from the lab.  (No one was in it at the time.) Most inner-city dialysis patients have quite a few medical problems, so it was immediately obvious what had happened.  My brother  fleetingly considered telling the candidate, "I'm sorry but you are very ill and need medical attention immediately."  They offered him another *well-monitored* chance and he declined.

Not in gamma rays, though.  You'd hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc, but if a decent fraction of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic  (but closer than 9 Mpc).  I dunno SN theory so well, but I can't think of how to get many gammas out.  Maybe I should look it up. Big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.  That's just in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but "bursts"? Nah. Neither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show that those energies *are* produced by things we know about. greg
I am currently searching for old video tapes of music groups of the early 80's to the late 80's.  At first I requested VHS formats, but now i'm accepting either VHS, 8MM, OR BETA.  The type of format i'm interested in are the type that most nite clubs or trendy clothing stores play.  If you do have any of these tapes just send me a reply with a few groups listed, i'll reply back if the groups listed are the type i'm searching for.  I'll gladly pay you what they are worth or trade for other movie or music videos, thanks.

I had ankle reconstruction (grafting the extensor digitorum longus to the lateral side of the ankle, along with a video arthroscopy of the ankle (interesting to watch, to say the least). Since then, I have had periodic muscle spasms (not cramping, but twitching that is very fast) in some of the muscle groups along the lateral side, and along the top of my foot.  TX with quinine sulfate produced ringing in my ears, but did help with the spasms. I am on flexeril now, but no discernable help with the spasms. Any ideas? One thing - I am in a short leg cast, so heat is not the answer. Renee Roberts

I hesitate to comment on the validity of this, because I do not know what your friend meant by it. If he meant that whatever exists must have been created, then he is open to the obvious retort that God exists, and so God must have been created. Perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a time when we did not exist, and therefore something other than ourselves must have brought us into existence. This seems plausible, but an atheist might reply, "So my parents engendered me. So what?" Here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of causes is not a satisfactory explanation. He would have some support from philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (Ayn Rand, and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle). Having argued for a First Cause, he would have to bridge the gap between said entity and the God of Abraham. If he merely asserts that the things we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically unlike them, few physicists would disagree.  Yours,  James Kiefer

----- Begin Included Message ----- The following teaching is brought to you on behalf of Malcolm Smith Ministries, a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a knowledge of the love of God.  If you would like more info on the ministry, and/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial, LOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14) by Malcolm Smith Moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation before the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh, gateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would have given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their decision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision- makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and destined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers had been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a sigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they were going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence. Whatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation at Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The forty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those who were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses prays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over. All these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden. His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. "Who is your God?" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When Aaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young bull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull who had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led Israel to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow thin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the God of Almightiness becomes "ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?" And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might be all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right to do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people had known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung on the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed God could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM and, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His acts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the day of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God. At Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He had seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This request was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious Person. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and lovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word "lovingkindness" is not to be understood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the love that says, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Lovingkindness is as tenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its heels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on feelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and, therefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion that wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our highest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings of love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with us! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him to reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not because of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed to us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will not let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us-- but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is saying to the recipient, "For as long as we shall live, I am for you."  The God who has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in His coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is lovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never leave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as love; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing miracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the heart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power. Moses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for these people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they could not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out of knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who gives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to miss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If man is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from love demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The language Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is waking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for, protected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were to ask, "What has the baby done to deserve this?" or, "Have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?" Our questions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was conceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is unconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally, spontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after His image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the Lord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if it survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in the love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and gladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His love. "Satisfied." in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our deepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems disappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the emotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in religious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life make sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it fascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His love. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by the knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew better. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes and satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God to make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the love of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church, we read of the Holy Spirit "falling upon" the believers. This is an ancient expression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in Luke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and "falling on his neck and kissing him." The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your being. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes. Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught us to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance and love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love we cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy Spirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to think on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded with the doctrine of "perform to be accepted." We begin to realize that He loves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge everyone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your eyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not feel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the other day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept behind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays without being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to Moses, "joy and gladness all our days." Joy is the result of a life that is functioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest performance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and, in joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings. ----- End Included Message -----

Andrew - continuing the discussion on the Deuterocanonicals... >: Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the >: standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we >: can ask: >: 1. Is it authoritative? > >"Authoritative" is not a quality of the writing itself- it is a statement >by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative. Arguably, it is both. Since authority is a matter of both communicator and recepiant we can say that, for example "Jesus is Lord" whether the world at large accepts the authority or not. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative content whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the heart of Pilate's pragmatic question "What is truth?" to Jesus when our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal to the authority of his Father) You also might like to consider the claimed authority represented by the statements "thus says the Lord" in the Bible, which claim to put across the exact words of God. You fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the "community of faith" - does something become truth because it is accepted? The main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward direction as well as a manward (which is where the reference to Rev 22 came in.) >: 2. Is it prophetic? > >How is "prophecy" to be defined? If it is "speaking forth" of God's message, >much of the apocrypha must surely qualify. If we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will cut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the book: Jesus' standards were that "Scripture cannot be broken". Can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha? (ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written) >: 3. Is it authentic? > >Again, by what standard?  Is "authenticity" a function of the authors? the >historical accuracy?  Does it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it - and does other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the authenticity? (archaeological, other textual evidence for example) >: 4. Is it dynamic? > >What is this supposed to mean?  Many of the apocryphal books are highly >"dynamic" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting. What this is getting at is the relationship between text and reader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should have the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and cause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this in Jesus' quote: "Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord". (Matt 4.4) >: 5. Is it received, collected, read and used? > >By whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some), >collected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are, >in the Catholic and Orthodox churches). Does the Catholic Church give the same authority to the Apocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as widely used as the OT and NT. >: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God. > >This is demonstrably false. Think about what I have said above. You may want to revise your conclusion. In addition think about other 'sacred writings', eg the Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would categorise them using the above principles. One word of caution - you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books: in that the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the Bible. Remember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel of light and quoting Scripture. >: To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: >: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and >: anachronisms. > >So do other books of the Bible. What were you thinking of? >[deletions] > >: How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the >: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to >: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. >: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will >: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the >: holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) >: Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions. > >These words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone, >not to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very >late into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary >role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture. We've lost the point and the context here. I am not arguing that the statement in Rev. can be applied indescriminately, just that the whole acceptance/rejection idea does not just follow on from man-made traditions - but there is I believe an act of God involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as Scripture and comes under the definition of 2Tim 3.16. > Barney Resson "Many shall run to and fro, & knowledge shall increase" (Daniel)

Hello. I just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation practice we do in my country.  I am not sure if it is going on also here in the US or any other country.  In all these 4 1/2 yrs. I've been here in Illinois, USA, I have not encountered it.  May I just call it "Traveling Fatima" since I don't know of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language. For certain regions in a district in a town or city, an image/ statue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home (originating from owner) to another.  This will stay with that family for one (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and other prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our Lady of Fatima.  The move will be like a simple procession of folks picking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing' prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the prior notification about the move.  There will be the 'receiving' prayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima image there.  It does not have to be that only members of the family in that home who must pray to the image.  They may invite others (or others/friends can invite themselves in ;^)) to participate during prayer time in that 'new' home everyday for one week. This image is moved from one family to the next within the bounded region of that district, until it goes back to the owner of the image. This is probably going on around there (Philippines) right now (or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot) and every year, this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima. It has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more likely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the image then is just moved next door. I am thinking of starting something like it in the village where my sister and her family lives.  Most of our friends and neighbors there are Catholics and practicing ones. I'd like to know if there are any state/community laws that this  practice will violate, whatsoever, before I go for it.  Thank you  for any comments or help about this matter. --

You assume that the general public "can't handle the truth" and then, based on this  assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a good argument, comes along and asks "why don't you just develop the spinoffs?" or "why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the military?"  There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them. >BTW: don't forget Velcro... And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right. Teflon has been around since before NASA.  As I understand it, Velcro was  conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes.  Certainly velcro was  available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties.  I would need to  see some good evidence before I believe that either of these would not be here today without NASA. --  		    "Find a way or make one." 	             -attributed to Hannibal

I'm not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to  be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except that they're newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now and when they're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.

Not useful unless you've got some truly wonderful propulsion system for the mother ship that can't be applied to the probes.  Otherwise it's better to simply launch the probes independently.  The outer planets are scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system, and going to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one.  Uranus is *not* on the way to Neptune.

Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence and modesty, and their importance.     The Most Beautiful Virtues     This story is an excerpt taken from The  Basket  of  Flowers   by     Johann Christoph von Schmid     In a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago,	there     lived  an  upright	and  intelligent man named Jacob Rede. He was     married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in     a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-     ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife	died,     leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even     as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,     her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss     towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare     and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such     indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one     looked upon an angel.     Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-     ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved     to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her     gender.  When	she  once, early in March brought the first violet to     him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:     Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-     ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes     itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in     retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-     ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be     like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to     attract the public	eye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in     quietude and peace.     One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the     garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,     as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which	was  beaming  in  the     morning sun:     Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem      of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-     test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:     they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure     and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the     hardest 				   -5-     to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;	touch     it	but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the     same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!     Then pointing to a rose he said:      Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More     beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to     the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure     of	heart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the     suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,     as	she  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.     The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with     their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least     indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and	wan,  and  go     before their time to the grave."     Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one     that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not     much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle     of	the garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was     born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it     blossomed  earlier	than  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The     tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that     she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at      it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father     and said:     Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling     of	red  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of     flowers!     The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes     once  more	upon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the     frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all     become  brown  and	yellow	and  when  the	sun came forth in its     strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter     tears at the sight. Then said the father:     Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my     child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced     from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree     an	image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way     - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has	raised	in  my	heart     should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,     then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed     over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your     cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I     should 				   -6-     go down sorrowfully to my grave.     As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,     and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her     mind that she never forgot them.     Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and	wise,  and  amid  the     flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-     gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring	as  a     violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.     Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the     fruits  of	his  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how     much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect     produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his     pious teaching and example.     Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together	in  a     bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:     The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one     to	the  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-     dered still more lovely by being together. In  the	same  way  my     dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and     cannot be separated     The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought     of the presence of God --  Viva Cristo Rey !! Long Live Christ the King.
   I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the    event and the 1/r^2 law.  So, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume    some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation),    could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic    events happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could    be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays     being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy. I believe the problem with this theory is that we see gamma-ray sources at that energy range and their energy doesn't seem to be significantly absorbed.

(Marty Helgesen) writes:    When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,    the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a    likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,    it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the    Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to    believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the    authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved    private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I    suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but    if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not    orthodox Catholics in good standing.) It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what happened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a Catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being called a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an offense, but not a heretic. Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human history.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church. "Approval" of an apparition by the Church principally means that whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith. I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling us what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us. Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of apparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into someone without a heart. The Fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the Church (we are living it), and what to do to save the most souls possible in such a situation.

Before more bandwidth gets wasted on this: I APOLOGIZE for my flame. First, because I distributed the message to so many newsgroups; I did        not check the crosspostings of the article I followed up on. Second, for not making my argument clear enough. I reacted to the tone         of many of the anti-Kirlian posts, not to their content. Right         or wrong, I found the arguments set in arrogant and sneering words         (that includes "jokes"), which I still think is unwarranted. And, obviously, I should not have done the same. -- Alex
First off, the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division is "Infiniti" not "Infinity."  I would also like to clear up the question of what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles, since a person had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models had V6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of each manufacturer used V8 engines. Lexus:   LS400- V8   GS300- V6   ES300- V6   SC400- V8   SC300- V6 Infiniti:   Q45- V8   J30- V6   G20- inline 4 (I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here) I hope this helps. -BSB

Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah's prophesies about the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding of their relationship with the Lord. Today the if the general populace  hears "prophesies" like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn ones, they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship (or lack of it) with the Lord. They are far more likely to think that they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter. That is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgement prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. This doesn't have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example look at Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech. The relevant section is below. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both prophesies posted here. --- Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural speech---- Both read the same Bible, and pray  to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem  strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing  their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ''Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh" If we shall suppose that American  Slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs come but which, having  continued through  His appointed time, He now wills to remove and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe  to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty  scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue,  until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of  unrequited  toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn  with  the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three  thousand  years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord,  are true and righteous altogether"   With malice toward none; with charity for all;  with firmness in the right,  as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we  are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have  borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which  may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves,  and with all nations. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w--- | Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not always true. In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them. Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kids that do them are "tough, just like a real Canadian".  Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. Doug Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming.  Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter. I used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But I'm starting to see his true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them, the more I think he's just an asshole. 								Alan

Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too. Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the "pony car" class came from) with a performance model. That's why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet  accessible--with room for performance tweaking. The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche, and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least, does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to  posting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to  delete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send  it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it. Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all  day for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has  them).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and  Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to  point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical  community. Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long  time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've  already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection. Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in  the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A). When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as  the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have  decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C (which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is  also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason). The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if  vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in  both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite). Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and  beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene  is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta- carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present (60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other  tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human  adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We  are born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about  30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they  were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that  of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is  not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient  reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S. The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of  vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet  surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A (either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National  Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the  RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to  7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was  killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main  reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient  reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to  move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move  towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have  some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely  important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that  battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the  1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the  dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the  1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill  the reserves). We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a  normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient  reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients. But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how  much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has  overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol  level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your  liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal  range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is  diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation  of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level  of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to  vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative  approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in  this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty  of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache,  redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain). I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they  had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear  signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient  needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you  will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for  PMS studies). Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will  never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to  retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the  liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But  taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to  fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30%  that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One  other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not  convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the  enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of  retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will  cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A. Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body  uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be  nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde (retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the  retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses  retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells  and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes,  one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the  title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play  a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role  is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake  of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But  retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once  it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC  group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's. Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are  helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and  they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do  themselves more harm than good. Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation. In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus  production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from  entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the "first  line" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown  to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which  stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration  and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters  are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not  normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process. This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials  in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene. Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that  vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who  walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be  worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already  has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my  course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic  medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures. Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night  vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The  serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver  reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have  trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled  out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels  were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below  20ug/dl. As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of  the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably  see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low  serum retinol levels. What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts from their book: Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for  growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for  reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie  malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and  metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid,  which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not  in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A  status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal  range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are  indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater  than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation  tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to  perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to  vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The  bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal  tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than  7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts  over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation,  erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois (bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.   They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A  deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol  level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in  adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule  out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical  lab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give  them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity  should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the  patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol. Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A. Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A. I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to  fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the  serum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the  vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a  demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will  provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status  are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more  agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But  vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could  become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human  fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is  18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on  the human fetus. Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes  but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use  retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it  full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to  prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup  jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A  supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I  think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market  but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general  public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.

Robert, I'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've  been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med. I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just  like I haven't read "The Yeast Connection"). Let me just start by stating that the authors of the "Cold Fusion" papers of  recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually  left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a  review of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actually  proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation. Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay  texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food  combining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind. But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent  oxidative damage in the body). Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove  that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you  use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees  I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in  commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this  kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I  couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really  guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is  that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to  produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so  they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct.  Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and  in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve  fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we  really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with  silicon?  Not in my book Robert. Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation  that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon  based life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I  know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to  separate the fiction from the fact. Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in  humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing  there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know  about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not  because silicon is transformed into calcium). Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective  tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show  that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective  factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin,  the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity  which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as  part of the ageing process in humans). For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which  calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon  in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the  bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going. Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming  cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in  the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency (by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of  defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also  another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an   undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not  transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing  observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into  calcium is an interesting little trick. But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and  yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without  a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group  are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any  better). If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base,  I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources  that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems  to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm  going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us  kindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label. For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's  interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric  neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his  name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in  our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with  brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventional" treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one  case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional  treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the  cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between  radiation treatment and surgery is guys?  I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the  chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which  do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it  because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are? How about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your  sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue). Marty B.

There was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary. During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they  were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is probably because of the "research mind" approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done. The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as  NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research. The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose, as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask for one?  The answer I will get is, "Get the money from NSF."  Now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much.   Also, the government decided that the "wealth" should be spread.  So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find  impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,  and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring  more than minimal attention of a good researcher.   I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders. --  Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399 Phone: (317)494-6054 {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)

:Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver :biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months :after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have :persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of :elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times :normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.  :As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.  :Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at :least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of :a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with :CAH needs to be treated. I just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seems that indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral, drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety of "thresholds" for electing to biopsy someone's liver.  Personally, I think that if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient, thus providing these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see if anyone's done any decision analysis on this. --  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   = =  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!" = =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America ! What I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them, and especially to many in wrong hands.... Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without affecting good/responcible gun owners ?? I DO believe in a persons freedom. What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it. MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE to give 'a little' to make that society work. Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point. Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b, so a car is essential in most parts.... Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't  argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars..... EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY! Is this discussion about 1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans             or 2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ?? Change of name....... Wrote that one after reading the first postings about the Waco 'incident'. I still think there are 'some' posters should move their post to alt.conspiracy or make a new newsgroup. (If you read the first postings after the Waco fire you should see who I mean......) Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons. (Child abuse for instance) Doesn't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari.news.* hierarcy ?? (Some seems rather mis/unInformed) (Or is the clari.news.* hierarcy ruled and censored by the corrupt facist goverment??)                                     Thomas Parsli

In my car it smoothed the idle and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough  to test for wear, but some people I know have.     A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors at least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50 he has went 5 years without an overhaul. Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers had ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be expected of 30K miles not 200K.

From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume it was tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up. Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized. The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say the linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.  What the space program did was to find a way to get it to stick.  Thus we had no-stick frypans on the market in the late '60s. ---

-*---- > I need information on the medical (including emotional :-) pros and > cons of circumcision (at birth). ... I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues such as this.  This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and time again.  The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances, both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of circumcision are minor.  This means that the decision is left to the religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the parents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or caregivers, at worst.  As (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this regard and not worry about it too much.  In terms of decisions you make for your child, it will have far less importance than many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents think about only a little.  This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a momentous medical decision.  It is not. Russell

This is not at all comparable. Christianity is the main stream in western culture. You are trivializing the experiences of others. I remember what it was like being "different" as a Christian. We were told all the time that we were different, and in fact that only members of the our church were really Christians (though others who believed in God weren't as bad as atheists), so we were a small minority. That was nothing compared to being an atheist. The only thing comparable would be a young child being Christian being surrounded by staunch atheists, including parents, who actively persecute any religious tendancies - both actual punishments and, even worse, emotional blackmail. They would also have to have the whole mainstream society on their side. Maybe these conditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union* not in a country with "under God" in its pledge of allegiance. * I doubt it even then, because children have to be taught to be Christians and hence must have support somewhere. >>I have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and >>having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves >>because I've been there.

[please, no flames about whether or >not gay people "choose" their lifestyle -- that's elsewhere in this >newsgroup] Yes. My atheism was "born of necessity." For an intellectually honest person belief is mostly a response to evidence. Will or wishes have nothing to do with it. I could choose to lie, or to be silent about my true beliefs. I could no more choose to believe in the God of Christianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to me. Still I should be clear that I'm not equating what I went through with what gays go through. However it is a mistake to assume that everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them. Happily some are made stronger, once we get past it. >> I must say that I >>wasn't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends >>who didn't become atheists. I was just hurt differently. > >i'm not sure i understand this sentence -- could you explain? Not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my childhood friends. Suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee that a person will be happy and strong emotionally, and a repressive upbringing can leave its scars even, or especially, on those who don't get free of it. I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and I feel no need to defend it. By the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the closet. In the end it has been, as someone eloquently put it in private email, an experience of liberation rather than disillusion. Bill Mayne
      Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my  question about which countries engage in space surveillance.  Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message  clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance,  rather than space surveillance       What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at  the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have  programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of)  satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance).      The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating  quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and  electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so.  The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing.      Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches  and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track  of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available.  See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as  the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The  material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in  optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be  that other countries do also.      Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do  it, and why do they do it?

>Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos? (I'm >not talking about Bronco II's, I'm referring to the Broncos that began >production in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe) 	Ahh Broncos.  Well personally, I have a '78.  The blue book is just a hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650 front end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000) 2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were  free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask, but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear axels, ford 9" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i  busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and  haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to  rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones that might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective wheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few dings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were discontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top for 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if you have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over 400 bucks to replace.  My bronco also does pretty good offroad, i haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over 3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too. One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a Toyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will have a hard time getting up into it. BOB

CNN just reported the ATF and the FBI have begun killing everyone in the United States. A press release stated this action was required because bugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their homes, and statistical data indicated that those who weren't might someday do something illegal. An ATF spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated that "this would clean up things once and for all". If the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the FBI has indicated they will "burn them, just like we did those kooks in Waco".  It hasn't been decided how the new proposed "energy tax" will enter into this, an IRS representative stated "We're looking at the tax code to determine if taxes really end at death. With this many dead Americans, we don't want to overlook anything". An ATF agent ran into the room, and shot her. Stay tuned....rich

Fred Gilham asks whether it is true that Goedel wrote a version of the ontological argument for the existence of God. Yes, it is true. Someone has published a rebuttal pointing out certain flaws in the argument, and recently Professor C Anthony Anderson, of the Philosophy Department of the University of Minnesota, has written a revised version of the argument, perhaps free of flaws, and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in the original version. He has sent me a copy, which I still have (I saw it last week when I was looking for something else), and when it surfaces again I can supply particulars. My guess is that it is being published (or already has been) in the Journal of Symbolic Logic.  Yours,  James Kiefer

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater  feels better in this aspect.

Of course the Kawasaki is the best of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time. The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000 kms is no better.

It answered the questions you ask (speculatively, of course), along with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies: length of day (for day/night temperature variation, and agricultural concerns), partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of xenon narcosis?  neither did I), density of particulates in the atm, and their composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun), etc.    Climate isn't a global phenomenon and probably needn't concern you, but axial tilt ought to.  It plays a large part in determining the severity of seasonal differences, and a lesser but still significant part in determining the speed of prevailing winds. Doug Loss
Two URGENT requests: 1. I need the latest update and description of MA bill S-897.  From    what I gather this bill takes the Hunter Safety Courses from    Law Enforcement and places them under Fish & Game control. 2.

: THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) : and Orbiter Duration.    : In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines : will be fired for a long period.

THe amount of OMS fuel : needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster : carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly : less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle, : for a given orbital change.   : From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are : tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's. : pat I haven't seen any specifics on the HST repair mission, but I can't see why the mass margins are tight.  What are they carrying up?  Replacement components (WFPC II, COSTAR, gyros, solar panels, and probably a few others), all sorts of tools, EVA equipment, and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can.  This should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission, which achieved the highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date.  And HST is now in a lower  orbit.   Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity. -- Steve Derry

I use a ZYGON Mind Machine as bought in the USA last year.  Although it's no wonder cure for what ail's you.  It is however VERY good at stopping you thinking! Sound strange?  Well suppose you're tired and want to go to bed/sleep. BUT your head is full of niggling problems to resolve, you lay in the bed, and quickly they all come to the surface, churning around from one unresolved thing to the next and then back again.  Been there, bought the t-shirt? I slip on the Zygon and select a soothing pattern of light & sound, and quickly I just can't concentrate on the previous stuff. Your brain's cache kinda get's flushed, and you start on a whole new set of stuff. A useful addition, is the facility to feed the output of a tape player or CD through the box, I use New Age elevator muzak to enhance the overall effect. DEFFO better than a pill.

>I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a >lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? >In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously >you aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive >to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies. I think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams,  or dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign  that he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit's way of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that we can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a  pure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy even when he dreams. Dreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples of people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.   Regarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be careful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else. Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate an out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE might actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE. In II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught up into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really leave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a spirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters that much.  Paul could not tell.   Be that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan to experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a  place until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If God wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His own sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are just taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking an OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was caught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some Jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one time.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it. People should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits for the sake of a few thrills. Link Hudson.
	Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway in world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was  quite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France). The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so. The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff behind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first point of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater.  I think that we will hear from this guy in the future.
I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions. The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was         leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem licked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months later!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I didn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the problem. I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch. My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal, the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it. What do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in? Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the passenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What can you suggest here? Many thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this... Bill Christens-Barry

	Often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) I've heard the passage from revelation: 	"...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes 	 words from this book..."     	 used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books. 	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons: 	 1.  They weren't added later by the Catholic Church; they were 		*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture. 		(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason 		to repeat the info.) 	2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote 		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was 		** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands! 	If one takes the translation of "this book" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere 	around there) to mean "all of scripture", then all of us are likely 	holding something that is in violation of this command. 	It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones 	(they didn't like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish I 	had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe 	that several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their 	most likely date of composition in the early second century A.D. 		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of  	Domition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are all 	in sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was "added" to the 	book after the composition of Revelation, when we are told to add  	nothing more. 	If you want to get the exact dates, get a copy of the New American 	Bible.  I'll try to follow this up tomorrow if I remember. 					- Mike Walker 					  (Univ. of Illinois)

    Editorial - A10, Saturday, April 24, 1993     CRIMESTRIKE HITS TOWN     With the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists     that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the     same column), we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re-     moving criminals from the streets the National Rifle Association's     new CrimeStrike project, engineered by Arizona's former chief assist-     ant attorney general Steven J. Twist.     CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily     crime.  It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally,     including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is     applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and     staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is     primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the     rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement.     Phoenix will be the home for this national organization.     The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun     control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek     reasonable regulation of firearms.     But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear     need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac-     countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals.     When an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and Crime-     Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars     to getting criminals off the street.     We say, welcome to town.

2) Hitting....Hawks tried to outmuscle Blues but could not do it. Instead, Blues matched Hawks hit for hit and crunched the shit out of them in game #4.....Scud line, Shanahan, Butcher, and Zombo particularly took turns bashing favorite targets like Chelios. 3) Skating.....when the Hawks tried to outskate Blues, they could not do that either.  Nelson Emerson finally showed up and skated circles around flat footed Chicago defense.....Hedican, Felsner, Ron Wilson and others also proved that with old cement skaters like Goulet and Keith Brown, Blues could lap Chicago in a 400 M relay race.      I agree with #2 but you are wrong about #3.  In fact, the only      point where the Hawks in any way matched the Blues was when      they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate      the Blues.  They scored and took the lead.  Too bad it was      Game 4 and they then took some stupid penalties.  When the      Hawks skated, they outskated the Blues and took control. --       Ian Neath        | There are four kinds of people in this world:
A question for any high-mileage Audi owners out there: I am interested in buying a 1989 Audi 5000S for $5500 Cdn.  The reason the car is selling for so little is that is has 155000 km on it (just under 100000 mi.).  The car's owner claims the car is in good condition.  My question is: how reliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high?  Would it be worthwhile for me to buy the car?  Any problem areas that I should look out for? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Post responses and/or e-mail me. Thanks Steve Hui --

hey folks, I'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before. I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously you aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies. Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives: 1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts. 2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane') Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in common by more than one person.  A mark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience. In this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and OOBEs as does in waking life. 3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a real existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe  different) moral laws apply there. So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know of another alternative?  respond by post or email. thanks very much *dt* ======================================================== .

Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though! It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie Gibson :-) >>   Who do you think gets the start in game three?

Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are binary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from a Sparc to a PC and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package ported to a PC), graphical object-oriented design (its all WSIWIG postscript),  supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around  the Mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like Unix with X, or DOS, or NT or  even VMS if you feel the need.

We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern postulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll get round to it eventually. The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship, with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling. Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time, and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book "How the World was One" [ I think that`s right ] If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely ignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true the Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they worth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have an affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned missions. As it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a space-RV, ( only not so cheap to run :-( ) --  __._____.___._____.__._______________________________________________________ __|_. ._| ._|_._._|__| Peter Card, Joint European Torus, Abingdon     | | | |_. | |    | Oxfordshire OX14 3EA UK. tel 0235-464867 FAX 464404   ._| | | |_. | |    | It wasnt me.

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause pregnancy, even in the presence of a hymen. I doubt that sperm could make  it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum, but it might be possible. So, it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant. Also, some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse without rupturing.

Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.   I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do. I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought  down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting, cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment  mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second  time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a  few years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two  servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down  and take it up again. Ben

Here's a game summary from the St. Louis Post-Disptach. Enjoy... By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff: At 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues goalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than Joseph."  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to the verge of a surprising sweep. Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks 3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second period of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds, a Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only two series the Blues have sweeped in their history. The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4, a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals. The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to make 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the Blackhawks couldn't touch Joseph. Well, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at  every opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues were unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way. The Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry -- wore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game. The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and scorers, who made the most of their opportunities. Craig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each period. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise Chicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final  period. Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling ``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep." They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour  ``Bell-Four. Bell-Four." They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye." Such talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are on a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels. The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan dumped Steve Smith at center ice. Chicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph backfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty. The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to Steve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw at him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly style is deadly. Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two shots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.   Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up. He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third penalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58, and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu slashed Shanahan. The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right shoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour dived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs. The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the Blackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds remaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by shooting the puck into the Blues' bench. Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and Marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues' power play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway point of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased the Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass. Try as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped everything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice. Emerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected Felsner's pass.   %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*   *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    %    %   \ \_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    *    *    \    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    %    %     \    ________/                                                   *   *      \   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        %    %       \  \                         Contact for the Blues             *   %        (___)             BLUES                                       *    *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

Although simplistic I have always liked the fact that "a Christian is one who not only believes in God, but believes God."  After all the name was first given externally to identify those who "preached Christ and Him crucified" to pay the price of their rebeliion and shortcomings before God.  God said this was His son -- I belive Him. --  University Registrar             talk: (703)463-8455   fax: (703)463-8024 Washington and Lee University    snail mail:  Lexington Virginia 24450 [It's certainly a good things for Christians to follow.

(Detroit, April 21) Most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the Detroit Red Wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to  another easy victory over the best team in the NHL.  For the best goaltender in the world, Felix Potvin, six was a bad number as he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse to the goon tactics employed by the inferior Red Wings team.

|> What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal |> suffering?  If it is Biblical, please reference. |>  |> Here's my train of thought: If God is using the Earth to manufacture |> heavenly beings, then it is logical that there would be a certain |> yield, and a certain amount of waste.  The yield goes to Heaven, and |> the waste is burned (destroyed) in Hell.  Why is it necessary to |> punish the waste, rather than just destroy it?   Luke 16 talks about the rich man and Lazarus. Matthew 25 talks about  the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations 20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are thrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and the fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where a fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the Matthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or in the sense of continual.    From Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell, if it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living forever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the  unbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on continually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it. It definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid regardless of its exact nature.  There seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought: What is God's main plan on earth? Why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed to simply destroying completely those who refuse God? I believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship with people. The nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more difficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something to avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has nothing to do with God. In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of hell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance, it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is burned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a physical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive, at some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is no longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement, the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical pain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are to be forever without God.    The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people won't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of the parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ. It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is not even remotely pleasant. --  Peter White disclaimer: None of what is written necessarily reflects       			a view of my company.

Buffalo fans: Some people in the discussion group, as well as "commentator Al" on ESPN,  believe that game 3 is critical for the Sabres.  HELLOOOO!!!!! The Sabres  are AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind.  As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well  aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that.  As long as  the Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are  still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at  Buffalo.  If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying.  Game 3 is  critical for Boston, not Buffalo. Rob Andolina
>When the Protestant reformers opposed and subsequently separated from the   >Church of Rome, the battle cry of the new protesting religion was "The   >Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible".

This idea, that the Reformers somehow were the first to bring the Bible to the people in their own language, is a myth.  Many vernacular translations of the Bible existed long before the Reformation.  The Vulgate Bible, which is still the official version of the Bible for the Catholic Church, was itself a translation in the common (i.e. vulgar == vulgate) tongue of its day, Latin, and had existed for about a millenium before the Reformation.    It might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented until the same century as that in which the Reformation occurred. -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University

Marriott)    News Advisory:    Results of the largest heart attack study ever undertaken, the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries trial (GUSTO), will be presented Friday, April 30, at the Clinical Research Meeting.    A press conference will be held at 12:30 p.m.    GUSTO evaluates the most aggressive emergency-room treatment strategies available to clear blocked heart arteries and restore blood flow to the heart, a process called thrombolysis.  The thrombolytic strategies compared in GUSTO use powerful drugs to break up blood clots in heart vessels quickly and prevent clots from recurring.  These strategies have never been compared directly in a large-scale clinical trial until GUSTO.  The results are expected to have an important impact on heart attack treatment worldwide.    The press conference will be held at two locations: live at the National Press Club, Main Lounge, 13th Floor, 529 14th St., N.W., Washington D.C., and via satellite at The Hotel Macklowe, 145 W. 44th Street, 4th Floor, New York City, between Broadway and 6th Avenue.    GUSTO results will be presented by Eric Topol M.D., GUSTO Study Chairman, professor and chairman of the Department of Cardiology at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Robert Califf, M.D., clinical director, GUSTO Coordinating Center and Associate Professor of Medicine at Duke University Medical Center; and Allan Ross, M.D., coordinator of the GUSTO Angiographic Substudy and professor and director of the Division of Cardiology at The George Washington University Medical Center.     ------    Editorial Notes/Attention television: The press conference may be viewed in its entirety via satellite starting at 12:30 p.m. (EDT) C-band Telestar 302, Transponder 2V (dual audio 6.2, 6.8) or KUSBS6, Transponder 8.

Apparently needing to clarify his comments from Thursday, Dr. Nizam Plawaby (spelling?), the Medical Examiner for Tarrant County, Texas, who has authority in the Waco deaths, stated that since no autopsies had been performed, there is no evidence for bullet wounds, or  evidence against bullet wounds. Janet Reno also stated that she had never been told of bullet wounds by anyone in the Justice Department.   --   | The Koresh cult standoff is over ... may his victims Recquiescat in Pace |  |                                                                          |  |                    (the above is a net.moment of silence)                |

When do the new M.benz "C" class cars come out? The new nomenclature that MB has adopted will it only apply to the "c" class cars or will it also apply to the current "s" class cars. Does any one know what will replace the current 300 class since the "c" class will be smaller and more in line with the current 190.  Another question, Is BMW realising a new body style on the current 7 series and 5 series. They seem to be a bit dated to me.
   >"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently,    >My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I    >would think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love.        If you are questioning whether or not "hating sin" is consistent with    Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:        Romans 12:9 "Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling                     to what is good."        What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is    calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would    eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to    do the opposite, to love your fellow man?    >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see    >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the    >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so    >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to    >hate the sinner.        That has not been my experience.  I've not found myself hating anybody    as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner    myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,    since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is    able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our    very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of    the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;    BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to    love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,    while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.    >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things    >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe    >what they are doing is a sin).        The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the    Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely    pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving    for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most    loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want    to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.    >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't    >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and    >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build    >love.        Again, I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of    the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified    in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we    can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and    they will have rejected it.        Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we    will, ourselves, be in sin.    >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our    >neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate.        I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New    Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.    >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.        Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.    Hope this helps,    In Christ,    Tony Balsamo --             +--------------------------------------------------+             |         Shrewsbury, Mass.              /_/  \    |             | Work #: (508) 841-2039                 \_\/\ \   |             +--------------------------------------------------+

If you've got a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration, sure you can use chemical rockets for that part... but even just doing the deceleration chemically is a major headache.  We're talking seriously high cruising velocities; taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto orbit isn't easy with chemical fuels. Incidentally, solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration system for something like this.  They don't go anywhere quickly.  (I speak as head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project, although that is more or less an honorary title right now because CSSP is dormant.) They can't fly a mission like this unless you start talking about very advanced systems that drop in very close to the Sun first. --

Organization: =CSE Dept., U.C. San Diego Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity? Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong, etc?  If not, why not?  Heterosexuals abstain all the time. (It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life) To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is this a myth).  Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are Christian. --  Darin Johnson

I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract.  Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes.  I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his current attitude, he is a detriment to the team. 								Alan

What is improved, what  |is Significant, and what does this have to do with carrying more  |equipment on a servicing mission?  Also, as implied by other posters, why  |do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway?  Maybe you have  |something here, but could you please clarify it for us on the net?  | RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks to 5,  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.   After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST's orbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up, they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers. I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit.  Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too. THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration.    In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle, for a given orbital change.   From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's. Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess, that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics, and still enough for a double magnum of champagne. or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit. The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing, and longer drag life. |> and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables |> so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the |> array tilt motors,  and god knows what else  is going to wear out | |From what I've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two  |sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.  The  |motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware.  I expect  |to be corrected if I'm wrong on this.  | a Whatever it is,  the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint on HST ops. pat

Well, we're almost halfway through the first round, and so far things are good in general:   1. The 2 teams that I hate most: Chicago and "Basten" are down 3 zip.      (even though there is a possibility either can still win their       series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the       underdogs (St. Louis and Buffalo) is so rewarding).   2. Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good      enough to go all the way, yet too good to be able to get some      (really) good draft picks... :-(   3. Is it just me, or does anyone out there also think that this year      the cup final should be played between 2 teams from the WALES?   4. Is it just because they're playing Montreal that I find the diques      arrogant ***'s, or are they really?   5. Smythe-what???? I'm really getting sick of seeing Douggie and Wendel      night in and night out... We should see some Canucks/Jets/Flames      action...!   6. Don Cherry is an ******* alright, but hey... so are our politicians...                    groundhog?               A.

> >[lots deleted, with which I generally agree; there is no inherently >defensible argument for the inclusion or exclusion of the Deuterocanonical >books] >:  I think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be  >:  consistently applied are not very useful as principles.  >:  So, if we are to exclude them (not accord them the authority of >:  Scripture) we would appear to require other reasons. What might these  >:  reasons be? Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we can ask: 1. Is it authoritative? 2. Is it prophetic? 3. Is it authentic? 4. Is it dynamic? 5. Is it received, collected, read and used? On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God. To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred Scripture. 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture. 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling. >:   >:  My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of  >:  (at least one of) these writings is one of those 'traditions >:  of men' one hears of so often. They were excluded during the >:  Reformation, and that appears to be the reason many people >:  continue to exclude them. But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and it wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw them out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't accept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical precedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the apocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead body' that it was included in the catholic canon. >The simple fact is that Protestant exclusion, Roman inclusion, Orthodox >inclusion of still other books, or any other definition of a closed canon >is the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection >of scripture shall be for that community.  They _all_ are "traditions of >men."  Whether one considers that to be a problem or not depends on which >community happens to be yours, and how you accept/ define authority within >it.  I personally believe that the concept of a closed canon, whether >Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox is one that developed rather late in the >history of the church, and which has not served the church well. How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions. It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus  that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the  OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51 taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture. >See Dr. Lee MacDonald's _The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon_ >(Abingdon, 1988) for a clear and faithful examination of the origins and >issues of the canon.

I've got 2 sets of sample cd's for sale set one (2cd's)-geared towards house/techno/pop and rap The 1st cd is all drum loops and drum sounds over 1500 of them The second contains analog synths, basses, bass loops,  wavestations, vox loops and much much more.  The second set- A variety of different sounds from new age to rock etc... kind of a sampler cd..(pardon the pun) Both have never been used and I can supply a list of categories for the sounds if someone is seriously interested. I'd like 130 for all three as they were $200ish new... Michael mail for more info

Aaron> Colossians 2:11-12 "In him you were also circumcised, in the Aaron> putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done Aaron> by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised Aaron> with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him Aaron> from the dead." Aaron> In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) Aaron> through a personal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's Aaron> faith cannot do this.  Do infants have faith?  Let's look at Aaron> what the Bible has to say about it. Yes, let do.  Try:  "And if anyone causes one of these little ones *who believes in me* to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck."  Mark 9:42 "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement for baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again, regenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the case of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the heart of the infant--through the power of the word. The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision. Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made a part of God's covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to be performed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this, and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the eighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier. Aaron> Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good Aaron> news.  For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?' Aaron> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the Aaron> message is heard through the word of Christ." Aaron> So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the Aaron> message of the gospel.   And the gospel is surely preached at any infant's (or adult's) baptism.  Indeed, in a very real sense, the sacraments are the Gospel made tangible. Aaron> Faith is a possible response to hearing Aaron> God's word preached.  Kids are not yet spiritually, Aaron> intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to Aaron> God's word.   How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith? Do you know this on the basis of God's Word, or from your own reason? Faith is also described as a gift from God, Ephesians 2:8,9.  He gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults, through the power of the gospel, Romans 1:6. Aaron> If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't Aaron> hold us guilty for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no Aaron> original guilt from Adam. Here you show that you just don't understand original sin-- you are arguing against a straw man. Maybe you've been talking to Catholics too much.  I don't know.  But original sin does not consist of God's imputation of Adam's guilt to us.  It consists of our inheritance of Adam's sinful nature.  It is actual sin.  See for example, the Augsburg Confession, Article II, and the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article II, and, for extra credit, John Knox's `The Scots confession', Article III. Aaron> Now then that we have a little more background as to why Aaron> original sin is not Biblical, let's look at some of the Aaron> scriptures used to support it. Aaron> Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through Aaron> one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to Aaron> all men, because all sinned--" Ask yourself this question.  "Do infants ever die?"  Then ask yourself, "If infant baptism is not valid, then where was the Christian Church during all the centuries when almost all  of the baptisms were performed on infants?  Were Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Zwingli, Hus, Knox, Andrae, and Chemnitz Christians? Aaron> Psalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time Aaron> my mother conceived me." Aaron> This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble Aaron> ourselves before God in repentance for sinning.  David himself Aaron> was a man after God's own heart and wrote the Psalm after Aaron> committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her husband. Aaron> All that David is saying here is that he can't remember a time Aaron> when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before God by Aaron> confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at Aaron> birth is a hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't Aaron> limited to a literal interpetation, but also uses figures of Aaron> speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).  For another example of Aaron> hyperbole, see Luke 14:26. Who are you to say what is literal and what is not?  Is a literal interpretation manifestly absurd in Psalm 51 by reason of direct contradiction with a clear passage from the Word of God? You might also compare Genesis 8:21, "The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart, `Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood...." Aaron> We see Aaron> that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The Aaron> implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he Aaron> knew to choose right over wrong. You are a long way from proving this (rather monstrous) assertion. All you can say is that Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature.  A conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation of reason, not on a direct revelation in Scripture. David H. Wagner			"But mad reason rushes forth and, a confessional Lutheran		because Baptism is not dazzling like 				the works which we do, 				regards it as worthless." 				--Martin Luther, Large Catechism, 				--Fourth Part, Baptism.

My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantially restored.  The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual mileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum and compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The body and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires, front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts. The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by a wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks. Questions: Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out? The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way of braking action? It seemed to be "doggy" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expect it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine? The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weather was cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever shrunk? Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed? Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price? Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  While my brother once owned an XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.  Any help with these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be appreciated.

Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing.  Coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in  its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  Any misalignment of the  plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will  require more fuel to adjust.  This was considered in the original deployment.  I agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous.   One has to admire how much they are trying to do.  Wm. Hathaway  Baltimore MD

Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the case with your wife. Thyroxin orally does "shut down the thyroid" through a feedback loop involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary "thinks" that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills for 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal. I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear. The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at beginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels. Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness, and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart), changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things. I am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the important thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they aren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get a second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explain things in detail to you and your wife. - Eileen Bauer

Ditto, if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on  standby. If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood there was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.   Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the NHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway, and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward. He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after that, and then I believe he retired.

The Hart Trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think in terms of who was the "best" player, rather in terms of who was the most valuable to the team.  And "valuable to his team" was not, and should not be, considered synonymous with "best".  We are talking about a time when honour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assets a player brought to his team, his league and his sport.  This was before the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was  formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory. The Hart Trophy is not a prize.  It is an honour. --                                             "So many morons... rm                                                 ...and so little time."

  Did anyone see the Montreal - Quebec game yesterday?  It was tight right down to the last second of the third period.  In the overtime Roy and Hextall played like they were gods.   Ok, so Montreal won!  They deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick.  Their second goal in overtime was also replayed, but I could not tell if it was the Montreal player who kicked it in.  The puck definitely was not directed in by a stick.

	For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also pretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work. 	Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So I used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually felt refreshed the next morning. 	So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and experimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought some generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try. 	For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry eyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some changes in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements) 	Anyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use (Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be a serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good, whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to lower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some kind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in any other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried many of the non-pharmacological solutions)
Hi sci.med folks... I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium. I have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex-wife.

I would like to  know whatever is important that I should know.  I worry about this sort of thing and would like pros/cons regarding Lithium therapy. I have a booklet from the "Lithium Information Center" based at the  University of Wisconsin, but feel that it is pro-lithium and would be interested in comments from the "not necessarily PRO" side of the fence.

Tod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go  and play in the former Soviet Union. This was arranged by Jets GM Mike  Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those  European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL. Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years. He wrote a book on his experiences called "Behind the Red Line" (check it out!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them. -- Mike  read Tod's book. I wanted to dig the book out to double check, but  realized I lent it to a friend, and he hasn't returned the book yet!  (Just wait 'til I get a hold of him...)

   (sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)   Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the  temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said "Dust grains acts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K."  Well, I was dead wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR, which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin. Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to take another ISM class :-(   In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is  that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller, already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].   He notes that the two recently discovered "Kuiper Belt" objects, 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same  mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks, formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to ideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different (Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence for the impact theory.   He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's  orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members of this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane  frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think) is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate, and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms bright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going to be very hard to see.   I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.   By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a Titan 4 to send the probe on "just about a rectilinear trajectory" to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs MUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million for 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the marketplace.   I'm just telling you what he said.                           Michael --  -----                                                    Michael Richmond
News: ===== For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not  a major part of the team.  Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has also scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles.  Thoughts on Game 1: ================== The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that was the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and  try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky Kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren Rychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees.  Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and  sweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off Chris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net.  Thoughts on Game 2: ================== The Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice. The first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win.  The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods.  The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury.  The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of Calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato drew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed 30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and Yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil  turtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at  each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)   Upcoming games: ============== Friday April 23, at L.A. Sunday April 25, at L.A. Tuesday April 27, home to L.A.  Thursday April 29, at L.A. (if necessary) Saturday May 1, home to L.A.

I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for "delay of game" for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans were starting to come up strong. I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events. If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example). But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all) Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries...).  In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.

[Anyway, your argument seems to be saying, "If _I_ were God, I certainly wouldn't do things that way; therefore, God doesn't do things that way."] I would never have the audacity to say such a thing. My argument says only that I do not understand.

>Phil, your point is well taken.  It is still a sad idea. I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds). (And I've been reading and (and writing) this thread since way back when it was only on sci.space). For starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus would be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit of propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the part of proponents. Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been levelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the target area. You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites. I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that SPS's weren't that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types. #2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested recently.  While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be concerned, and something any project like that would work against anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find many activists in Murmansk demanding the "natural" sky back. If anything, he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp, making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the "day." The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass advertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't have lived without before. And I doubt anyone's going to really be able to convince them to stop. -- Phil Fraering         |"Number one good faith! You convert,

In the Monday, May 10 morning edition of the San Jose Mercury News an article by Sandra Gonzales at the top of page 12A explained convicted killer David Edwin Mason's troubled childhood saying, 	"Raised in Oakland and San Lorenzo by strict fundamentalist 	Christian parents, Mason was beaten as a child.  He once was 	tied to a workbench and gagged with a cloth after he accidently 	urinated on his mother when she walked under his bedroom window, 	court records show." Were the San Jose Mercury news to come out with an article starting with "Raised in Oakland by Mexican parents, Mason was beaten...", my face would be red with anger over the injustice done to my Mexican family members and the Mexican community as a whole.  I'm sure Sandra Gonzales would be equally upset. Why is it that open biggotry like this is practiced and encouraged by the San Jose Mercury News when it is pointed at the christian community? Can a good christian continue to purchase newspapers and buy advertising in this kind of a newspaper?  This is really bad journalism. I'm upset.

I don't believe there was a "suicide pact".  I believe that Koresh wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers. In fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' stories. >*	Everyone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape >	the falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was set.

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada. The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time, it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room. It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they  have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73 Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom. --  MIKE HARKER OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA VOICE: 613-823-6757
>When Elizabeth greeted Mary, Elizabeth said something to the effect that >Mary, out of all women, was blessed.  If so, it appears that this >exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity. I don't see how this logically follows.  True enough, Mary received a blessing beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be  the mother of the Savior.  It says nothing about Mary needing to be a "blessed  person" _first_ in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the Son of  God.  Again, I think the problem is that as humans we can't comprehend how the  sinless Incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and God's Spirit. Rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of God, we must needs try to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be.  Mary's own words,  "...my spirit rejoices in God _my Savior_, for he has regarded the low  estate of his handmaiden,..." sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity, in need of a  Savior, similar to what David proclaimed in his psalms...not the words of a holy being with no further need for God's grace. I really apologize for harping on this, I don't suppose it's important. It's just that I see Mary and Joseph and the Baby reduced to placid, serene figurines I feel we lose the wonder in the fact that God chose to come down to you and I, to be born of people like you and I, to share our existence and redeem us from it's fallenness by his holy Incarnation. -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........   .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . .  .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .     .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .

If I'm going to drive on a public road then I need a speedometer, and an odometer helps for navigation.   My 1965 Chevy has a bare minimum:  Engine-temp and Oil-press warning lights and a fuel gauge.  My 1983 VW has tach, water-temp, voltmeter  and oil-temp gauges.    If I had a turbo car, I'd want a vacuum manifold/boost gauge.  An oil pressure gauge is a nice, reassuring gauge to look at.  If my car was air cooled, then I would substitute a cyl-head-temp gauge for the water-temp gauge.   A few years ago, I looked at the Audi Quattro Si Coupe that Bobby Unser used to win the 1986 Pikes Peak Hill Climb. The gauge layout, from left to right, top to bottom was:   ----------------------------------   speedometer   ----------------------------------   fuel                  tranny press                 temp   ----------------------------------   differential           water temp                   temp   ----------------------------------   big orange             tach oil-press warning light   ----------------------------------   oil-temp               boost   ----------------------------------   oil-press   ----------------------------------    Alex

That's right, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers of the book were inclined to disbelieve in it.   I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo. For his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half down between the same two plates, and took another K. p.  The "missing half" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind  after the first photo. This explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasn't there when it happened.

I think it was - he went into town fairly often, and was known to go jogging.  This was even during the 9 month period when he was being watched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned according to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting them, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted to have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell... He was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered peacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully). He has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY. The justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased $200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period). Last I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of an INDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door shoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody I know of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you? I sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated like the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, it is a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the BATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt people having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved religeous group.  Are we required to not offend the BATF these days?  I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT... MY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP.  We need an independent investigation, and NOW.  Assuming other than FBI/BATF are preserving the evidence. >2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome. They had the premisis bugged.  I am inclined to think a further wait would have saved lives.  One wonders why they didn't have emergency gear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the water when a fire was observed, instead of saying "aw, gee, there is no water". Why so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building had pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decision the firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn't the Feds TURN IT BACK ON?  They sure could cut it off quickly enough... One does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'... >3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action? > >And a few other questions.

You think she is going to be facing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You think she is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to have acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick, though. I am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation for possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI. I expect to hear "they are our best law enforcement.  They wouldn't do anything like that - NO WAY.  OUT of the QUESTION.  End of issue". I want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full prosecuting and subpoena powers.  With felony prosecution where felony acts are found. Fat chance, I bet.  I bet the Justice Dept will have an internal investigation which will turn up at most 'poor judgement'.

Subject: ----->Those nasty insurance people --------------------- Hello everyone,    I have an insurance question. Allstate insurance SITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person  reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost  exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is "totalled" because of  exceeding repair costs. Person says "WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!" and takes it to  another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the  dealer. One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred  in Pennsyvania. QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this,  now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled? Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of  thing.  Thanks...

Dear Netters: Maybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experience  a strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which  can be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that one  experiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say, it is not  enjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme  fatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts  that long, it makes me sweatening. Initially I called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until I later learnt that  the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats. So, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person? I always believe I am unique.  Thanks. Ping

Do you really think that in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS? For what it's worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin for "candida hypersensitivity syndrome."  It was published in the  New England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic symptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not surprisingly).

If you were to start your own religion, this would be fine.  But there is no scriptural basis for your statement, in fact it really gets to the heart of the problem.  You think you know more than scripture. Your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the Word of God.  Just because they are nice people doesn't make it right.  You can start all the churches you want and it won't change the fact that it is wrong. That is not to imply that gays don't deserve the same love and forgiveness that anyone else does.  But to call their behavior right just because they are nice people is baseless, and it offers Satan a perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing.

Or what other things perhaps? For your first set of questions (regarding the energy and will of Christ) I quote to you the relevant part of the Statement signed by both Eastern (Chalcedonian) and Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox scholars a few years ago (Both families = both Orthodox churches) : 1. Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families confess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten of the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and was born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect man with soul, body and mind  ($  \nu o  \upsilon \zeta $); He  was crucified, died, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the Heavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all creation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the Church as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His glory, according to the Scriptures. 2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of Theodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that Christ is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and by nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature God,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time. 3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by uniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which He has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature, which He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will and energy. 4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ are united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ without  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ thought alone. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis of the Logos Incarnate. [...] I guess that adresses your question adequately. As for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the discussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see how they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an endless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief answer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church  regarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc. is exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.

Is there another newsgroup that                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A >  might have specifics on herbal remedies? A >  A >  Robert Allison  I tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems,  so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.    Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should  generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid   complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)  you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other  major component of the bioflavonoid complex.  I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it  showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-  fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in   hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids   to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.  Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so  there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole  bioflavonoid complex instead.  I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that   they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose   bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...  One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day  for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.     They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can  be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are  made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.  About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency,   with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.  For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.    In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they  are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine   bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite  small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times  higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark  extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.  The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'       Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:      Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable    Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing     Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable     SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing      Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!    -- Ron Roth --  =====================================================================  *   "Eating Radium has strange results,"  Tom said brightly. ---    RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]

Well, this isn't the right group for this, but I have to say that I don't think violence is any more socially acceptable now, by any means.  How can you say that when we used to have of pistol-toting gunslingers as  heros, or even gangland thugs being considered romantic.  Do you think our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys and indians?  I don't think so.  That behavior was somewhat encouraged back then, in fact. I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California, we here  about it in MA the same day.  Back in the old days, they'd never hear  about something like that, period.

I'm a nursing student, and I would like to respond to #66966 on haldol and the elderly. First, I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go through this.  I know it has to have been tough. There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly adults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of the body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions between medications can cause confusion. As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after the drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anything to that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that information. I can see what I can find... I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to the Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is "Especially useful for agitation associated with senile dementia"  (p. 400).  It also should not be  discontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lasting effects. Because so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know what else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be able to answer you better.  If you want to send me e-mail with more information, I would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might have happened. Elisa
Computer Equipment Garage Sale: I've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff that is broken or not being used by me.  I've put together a list and indicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I am very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for some CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy  disks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically  anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)   Make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked...  I really want to get rid of this stuff... Ok, Here's the list: 52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy 	at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem  	to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The 	guy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk  	Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy)  	I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to  	him. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set)  	so maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't 	work so I'm trying to minimize my losses.	~$45 52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above. 	I bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different 	model numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD 	(I have one for each drive) will be included.	~$45 40 Meg SONY 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism  	is completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and 	had a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the 	computer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which 	was not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller 	card is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a  	project.	~$20 65 Meg Seagate 5.25" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought 	this drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that 	I could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine, 	and that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending 	proper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive,  	looking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I 	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the  	drive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good 	at soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed 	up.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on 	me.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications, 	worth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C, 	Excel, and many others)  	I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all 	the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only  	ask that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry 	when I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't  	have time to play with it any more.	~$65 AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know 	what this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I 	have some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an 	AT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in   	working order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how  	this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested. Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone  	is interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I 	had trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the 	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without  	another controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the 	prices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.	~$65 CGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although 	I think I was using a bad monitor)	~$5 5.25"	360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work,  	because when I took it out of the PC, it was working!		~$25 5.25" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to  	work.  Came out of same PC as above.	~$25 5.25"	Floppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't 	even know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have 	any method of testing them. 		Panasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another 			number on it: 2626-361723. 		Panasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also 			another number on it: H3649-101457 		Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one  			above. 	Each Drive ~$10 3.5" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I 	think it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I 	suppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number 	DFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35 MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way 	of testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit 	card with a floppy controller built in.	~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for 	the 16-bit card w/floppy. Interesting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is, 	standard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No. 	D1181-80020		~$10 I've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many  satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I  usually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet)  and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated. Well, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you  can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate to throw away stuff... -Wayne (617)-225-9349
I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955.  There  is a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in the groin.  The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a young woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did the honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they lived happily ever after.   Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would come into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about 3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, "Boys, do you know what this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's used to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up there without an anesthetic!"  Needless to say this had a chilling effect. I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.  Later in life as I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible urethral sounds that are actually used, I could not escape thinking that I might one day see, "Reamer, Cock (style of Rau) ."         ]
Colonics were a health fad of the 19th century, which persists to this day. Except for certain medical conditions, there is no reason to do this. Certainly no normal person should do this. Frequent use of enemas can lead to a condition in which a person is unable to have normal bowel passage, essentially a person becomes addicted to enemas.  As I understand it, this is a very unpleasant condition, and it would be best to avoid it.
Speaking of Roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol' gln?  I had him in my kill file since last year's playoffs and now that I've moved to a new news reader which doesn't have kill files, I find that he's gone.  I must admit, however, that unlike gln, Roger seems to know something about the game as long as the subject doesn't touch on the Leafs. Ray Skirsky

Fordham)       The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is  extremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal  infection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the  Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted  2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed  invasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The   orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive  for HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing,  representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon  performed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were  tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All  patients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent   assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.   The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect  cases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of  the initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single  most  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37  percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were  conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who  was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.   Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive  and expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \         =================================================================      "Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV- Infected Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol.  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.)       The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be  quantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar  investigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins  University School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a  total of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical   procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was  listed as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for  all patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were  obtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413  had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No  study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly  detected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably  infected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369  person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to  patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours  of surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to   suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control  guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to  be tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was  found to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably  the result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,   there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive  surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.        ==================================================================                                 April 20, 1993        ==================================================================  "Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10   (Kolata, Gina)       A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly  unusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are  undergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the  Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He  said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it  had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective  in fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that  HIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at  different sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the  mutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one  after the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies  do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new  agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data  on new AIDS drugs.  "An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a  much more  efficient way," said Scolnick.  He also said that the   collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement,  Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.   Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute  of Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, "We're delighted to see the   pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the  information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for  Inquirer (04/20) P. A3; USA Today (04/20) P. 1B  ==================================================================  "The Next Step in AIDS Treatment" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 493   (Maddox, John)       Although AZT was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives  of  people infected with HIV, the findings do not indicate that  AZT should not be  administered in people with full-blown AIDS,  writes columnist John Maddox.   AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on  the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of   T-cell counts.  However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should  not be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877  people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving  only placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the  proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to  death were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The   conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected  individuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the  progression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study  of the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already  appeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the   evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has  proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV  infection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the  beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of  disease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself  provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes   Maddox.        ==================================================================  "Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected  Women" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe  et al.)       A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM  type in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of  HIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized  that  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the   presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in  breastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were  enrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6  months, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were  assayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with   protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral  genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of  primers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post  partum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97  percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent;  and IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived  longer than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of  persistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1- infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of  HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.   The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM  response was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in  breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers  conclude.        ==================================================================                                     April 21, 1993        ==================================================================     "Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture" Journal of Commerce  (04/21/93), P. 7A       A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced  Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS  research to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV  infection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily  from the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies  since  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual  AIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories,  led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come  together, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies  involved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche,  Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck,  Syntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The  participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they  were aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively   involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the  collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong  scientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 and early clinical data.  The  American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR)  was pleased with  the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to  the  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.    ==================================================================     "Guidance Over HIV-Infected Health-Care Workers" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341,  No. 8850, P. 952  (Horton, Richard)       The United Kingdom's Department of Health recently followed the  advice  of AIDS experts that there is no scientific reason for  routine HIV testing  among health-care workers.  Following recent  highly publicized reports of  health professionals who contracted  HIV, the department issued revised  guidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief  Medical Officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care  workers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV   infection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing.  He said,  "Infected health care workers should not perform invasive  procedures that  carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to  the virus."

Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993. The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.) Topics ------ Don's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter. Episode Summary --------------- This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.) Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr. Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the "greatest goalie", and said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself. He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised "Don't Trade Fuhr!" Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the trade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated. The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver game, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty. Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved, but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: "Its sad what they're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed." Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto. People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke "Wendy" for not fighting. However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either. This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking: "It's like college hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody. That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you won't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made by people who don't know what's going on in hockey". The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was taught to "play to win", which differs from today's idea of just letting kids have fun. At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like one of the chipmunks. Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some good quotes. I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------     \  \                  |Department of Computing Science,      \  \_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.       \    ###  \     _   |---------------------------------------------------        \___###___\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the  credit..."          - U. of A.

The FBI had their first team in place, massive resources, ample time  for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary.   They still botched it.       The FBI Director and the FBI SAC in overall charge should resign, or be fired for incompetence.       I don't blame Reno or Clinton.  They gave the FBI clear orders: don't go in unless you can do it without casualties; if you can't do that, wait it out.  Those were reasonable orders.

>Perhaps you consider that Hitler was not responsible for the Holocaust  >since the allies could have done more to stop him? Attention please! According to the rules of usenet flame wars, once a discussion degenerates to the point where Hitler is mentioned, that flame war may be declared ended.  I would like to take this opportunity to do that now.  Clearly further discussion is not useful with the current set of facts, and the current name calling and invocation of Hitler's name is not productive even by the standards of usenet talk groups. If you must continue, please don't discuss this in misc.legal.  It's not about the law.

Not only the Sonett (correct spelling), but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan used a 1500 cc or 1700 cc V-4 from Ford of Germany.  This particular motor had a 60 degree vee angle, a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust ports.  This motor was later stretched into the V-6 commonly seen in the Capri. The V-4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size.  But in the Saab, it made too much torque for the transmission, which had been designed for a 3-cylinder 2-stroke.  -- Chuck Fry, former Sonett III owner --  			 [this space for rent] 	  I alone bear responsibility for the claptrap above.
>>of Faith (if you want to know, I feel that faith is intellectually >>dishonest).  > >I'd appreciate some support for this statement.  I'm not sure >it really makes sense to me. I define faith as "belief, in the abscense(sp?) of evidence". I also include in "evidence" past experiences. Because I have no past experience in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional works I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god(s). From what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by using faith. It is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word "faith") that I find intellectually dishonest. >>The ambiguity of religious beliefs, an unwillingness to take >>Pascal's Wager,  > >I've heard this frequently - what exactly is Pascal's wager? Pascal's wager goes something like this: Premise #1: Either there is or there isn't a God. Premise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not believing. Premise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesn't matter because death is death, anyway. non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong. Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is, Premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is flat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the fact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have heard theists referred to as "99% atheists" because they believe in their god (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of this is "what if I pick the wrong god?" Suddenly, the odds don't look so good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another god's version of hell. >>	Do I sound "broken" to you? > >I don't know.  You point out that your mother's treatment upset you, >and see inconsistencies in various religions.  I'm not sure if that >constitutes broken-ness or not.   It certainly consititutes  >disillusionment. I don't see how "disillusionment" enters into it. You see, I presented my mother's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a questioning which continues to this day. I had already been an atheist for five years before having any contact with my mother's version of Christianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with atheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?). Yes, in a way, I have also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because I had thought at one time that they had all the answers, if I only found the right one. I'm still looking, but each time I look in a different place, I become a little stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though, it's based on the evidence of past experience) that I'll never find a religion which has all the answers. Sorta like looking for Easter eggs. The more time it takes you to find the next one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found all the eggs you're going to find. Someone else mentioned that critisism isn't going to make me think any more highly of Christians. I have a contrary position: Constructive critisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians. Abusive critisism will turn me off. No accusations to you, Mr. Sapienza.

Subject: [sleep] the pulse of relaxation; roaming while sleeping      I posted about a "pulse of (relaxation) electricity".  I now think it more like a pulse of "relaxation" or comfort than a pulse of electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.      Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So, you feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat). Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your body.      "Shiver" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake. What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body experience? 					Daniel Chung (Mr.), U.S.A.

The Bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by Malcolm Bricklin, who, I believe, was Canadian.  He was the first one to import Subarus, and later was responsible for importing Yugos, I believe.  Anyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports car, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features.  The Bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car.  If any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to design "experimental" safety cars, you will recognize the general appearance of the Bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc.  Anyone recall other safety features?  The engine was an american v-8, Ford I think is right. Personally, I kinda like the way they look, and if I remember from the old magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad.  The choice of colors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly visible, I suppose.   The Delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (IMO) but no motor at all.

daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to  	I am unable to post to the bitnet groups. 	Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement in the Churches of Christ (i.e. Crossroads/Boston): 	I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of its roots go back that far, but these were really "influences" on the Movement, and not the actual movement, per se. 	I will start in c.1920. 	In that day, there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches in nearly every area (due to segregation).  Modern Pentecostalism was developing as a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism, emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. 	Many 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became known as conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was in full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it. 	When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and  1960's), many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches and by what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groups and spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's.  In 1969, even the Catholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other  groups...still evident today. 	The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant group.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it was generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly  resistant to change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo. 	The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it unfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out to college students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus  Evangel- ism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large, played a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people  began to speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did). 	This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of  Christ. In some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or  for advocating the "Holy Spirit Movement", another name for the new branch.  The term "Underground Church of Christ" also came into use because these people  had to hide their differences (or they might be ostricised). 	There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were receptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never  really caught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville, FL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street,  and the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also  seemed to put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking. 	In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to be its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's (lead) Minister.  In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with  many other groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring  Break. They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus. They also worked with UF sports people. 	In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed. When it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer appropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name that would become legendary. 	By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs were fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn't start it, they  continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going. 	By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal problems at Crossroads. 	Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require  attendance at all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of your problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer  Partners, which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  The leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while. 	The book called "The Master Plan of Evangelism" was a strong influence on Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person's duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growing in number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important). 	A person who "was evangelistic" was "spiritual".  Evangelism meant inviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them converted, then you were "spiritual".  There were sermons about how if you bought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to services.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since these people needed Jesus, you should be "aggressive"--don't take 'no' for an answer. 	If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called "lazy" or "unspiritual". 	By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated  into a structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Then the group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in had someone placed over them. 	It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads began to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus was tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate problem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its "pushy" evangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ to be "dead" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting out of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM. 	By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100) where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but also they were sending out "planting" [create a new church] and  "reconstructing" [reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, the Crossroads Movement was underway. 	A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in  Boston, MA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a fraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view of church authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s), and not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the  congregation that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong with his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over- one Christianity.  [Called this by critics] 	In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want  to be a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming into the new Boston Church of Christ. 	Ah, but I'm ahead of myself. 	At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on the members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but they were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers were dropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadership began to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely "unproductive" and "unfruitful".  The "fruit" passages in the NT were  interpreted as referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15,  you would be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.] 	If you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to church and convert him).  If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor. And if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding.  The logical arguments continue in this vein. 	In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to  recurring sins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at large, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.   For by now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most Crossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus should be on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.] 	Chuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the Boston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training'  sessions for other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross- roads ready to emphasize the "total commitment" to the church that Boston and Kip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at  Crossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision. Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under the direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their  belief that each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston  Churches of Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since Crossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement.  The group now numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership). 	The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary element of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship' baptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be baptized.  You had to 'count the cost'.  At Boston, they took this a step further.  If at some time you became "unproductive", then your spirituality was suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you were getting into.  Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid:   they hadn't counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others  called this "rebaptism", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice. 	When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its members left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were now called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing)  or you were "dead".  They also used the nickname "Movement of God" for a while. 	By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now stood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ, and now none in the Movement. 	Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that they had been following.  They sent "reconstruction teams" to many cities,  which usually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging  other churches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the "remnant". The "remnant" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It was felt that the "remnant" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes they would simply call their Movement "the church". 	They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the other Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Many campuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there due to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented that Boston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to  have access to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed "perse- cution", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you really a Christian if you're not being persecuted? 	The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they have fought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the leaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) as God commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and obedience. 	Crossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by the Cult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult, under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  The term "cult" is usually differentiated from "sect" by the practice of those techniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being techniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding Discipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many others have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt  motivation, emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort of mystic element seen in everyday events), and others. 	I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer- ous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a 'falling out' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they  teach. I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system. I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their mistakes either. 	I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which are in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much victims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoys manipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel accountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  When members do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel personally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power. They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime. 	I have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are many examples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston  bulletins) that I could include.  But this is too long already.  You may post this if you so desire.

> I was just wondering if exercises specific to particular regions of the > body (such as thighs) will basically only tone the thighs, or if fat > from other parts of the body (such as breasts) would be affected just as > much. There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to "spot reduce" body fat other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like "fat", so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the "fat" is "changing" into "muscle", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate, and one does not ever "change into" the other. ------------------------ Philosophy Department;Wesleyan University;USA

I just wanted to point out, that Teflon wasn't from the space program. It was from the WWII nuclear weapons development program.  Pipes in the  system for fractioning and enriching uranium had to be lined with it. Uranium Hexafloride was the chemical they turned the pitchblend into for enrichment.  It is massively corrosive.  Even to Stainless steels. Hence the need for a very inert substaance to line the pipes with.  Teflon has all its molecular sockets bound up already, so it is very unreactive. My 2 sense worth. Bill

Ordinary massage is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular or joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their technique. In the case of massage, there is a technique called "deep abdominal massage" in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines! The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease syndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up and passed out. I just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it!  The human intestine is not a New York City sewer pipe!  And even if it were, you eat half of a small box of Triscuits, and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to the inner surface of your intestine  :-)

You then cut off part of the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  You see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn't nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between photographs.  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place conducts electricity.

In-Reply-To: 's message of 21 Apr 93 16:54:32 EST    A good source of information on Burzynski's method is in *The Cancer Industry*    by pulitzer-prize nominee Ralph Moss. Interesting. What book got Moss the pulitzer nomination? None of the flyers for his books mention this, and none of the Cancer Chronicle Newsletters that I have mention this either.    Also, a non-profit organization called "People Against Cancer,"    which was formed for the purpose of allowing cancer patients to    access information regarding cancer therapies not endorsed by the    cancer industry, but which have shown highly promising results (all    of which are non-toxic). Moss is People Against Cancer's Director of Communications. People Against Cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information, not exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to. Most (maybe all) of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer, and many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well. sdb ---

Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth, you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with the newsreporting if you care. Many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he is lying, change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their stories to match the Feds.   Neither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested, but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves to the ratings and deliberately distort.   For me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus  being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto, so made the decision.  He and his followers also probably felt that they were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).

- - I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton. - Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference - next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed - to concern the Oiler's future. - - Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement - with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference, - Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that - the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to - renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium. - - Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier, - but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington. - - As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly - supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market - team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems - that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans - than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if - the team does move, there is no place more deserving than - Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand - realignment scheme of Bettman? -   Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The government said that Pock is going nowhere!   Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be Tory leader 9 years ago? Dave Shariff Yadallee (B.

Roger, Your responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions, then.  You see, the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL are the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like wheat at harvest-time.  She never said she represented the entire internet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey.  She has every right to state her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or hundred-odd folk who've agreed to allow her to list their names on the bottom of it.  You may not agree with it.  Fine.  I really don't care enough about the name change to care.  Your name isn't attached to it, so why moan and complain?  If you felt her words were leading, well, you're free to feel that way and take exception, but manners never hurt.  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine (I have the right to think and say that, too).  Ali's under no compunction to change a single word.  Now, while you're free to disagree with every word she wrote, to tear apart her character is uncalled for.  I'm posting this as a form of public reprimand.  If you tear down Ali's integrity and character publicly, you'll get chastised publicly in return.  Would it have been so hard to say, "Ali, please be a bit more specific in your description, the way I've read it indicates you're stating my view also, and that's simply not true. I'd really like to see a disclaimer noting that you don't mean the entire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it, despite your intent to list names at the bottom.  Thanks.  Cordially as always," &c.  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the weight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of myself, and possibly others.   Oh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even if it's not something I personally advocate.  :-) --  Valerie Hammerl 	       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab  get that feeling, and the only way was to learn how to skate."

american and european universities were full of Angry Young People(tm) that wanted to overthrow the government, and wouldn't think twice about lobbing a molotov cocktail at the national guard (military police in Europe.) Certainly, it would have been very bad form to take anything the System(tm) said at face value. This was in the end of the sixties and the begining of the seventies, I'm told. I was too young to remember. Something wrong happened along the way, I'm afraid.  Maybe the west became just too comfortable, or maybe I was born too late :( Yours, disappointed with with the youth of today, PS: 1) Half smilies implied.     2) There *is* a difference between lining up 90 people against the        wall and executing them, and causing their deaths through negligence/        imcompetence.

This is my own  guess, based on similar designs flown on other large STS-launched s/c  (GRO, UARS).  Also, there _might_ be some consideration given to mass  requirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional S/A).  Finally,  the HST arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember, they're  going to be replaced with new arrays. However, as an ACS guy who's seen his branch management pull their collective hair out over HST, I would voice a hearty 'yea' to using conventional arrays over bi-stems, whenever possible.  No half hertz flexible modes, no thermal snap, no problem.

:  : In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom : 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. : Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about : idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at : least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this : passage.  It does not use the word "homosexuality", and it is referring : to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. : So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.

Also, as was observed at : the very top of this post, Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the : mother of Jesus, who was definitely without sin. If the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give birth to God, then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus?  For that matter, why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin either?  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing through each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have none puts God in a box, where we say that He couldn't have incarnated Himself through a normal human being. My God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His purpose.  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth with the appearance of great age; providing a path through the Red Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the right speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal sinful person without being tainted by her original sin. I see far too much focus on the "objects" of religion and not nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to all believers with the Author of our existence, without the necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits to God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope. : Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the : Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned : during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also : held by the Catholic Church. If Mary was born without original sin, and didn't sin during her lifetime, how is she any different from Jesus?  This means the world has had two perfect humans:  one died to take away the sins of the world;  the other gave birth to Him?  I would certainly want to see some scriptural support for this before I would start praying to anyone other than God.  Everything I have ever read from the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless Lamb of God, not His mother, grandmother........ : Hope this is useful to you.

It's always a two-way street.  God gave her the grace to avoid sin, thus when she was visited by Gabriel, she gave her fiat, her total acceptance of God's will.  This fiat summarizes why Catholics regard  her as the highest of all humans, that God chose her and that she accepted.  Knowing this in advance, we extrapolate that she was neither stained by nor subject to original sin. God did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin. "Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of God to command it."  This amount of grace was precisely determined by God to be the amount required to do what God asked of her.  The grace given to each of us is also enough, but we do not always choose to accept it.  We also believe Jesus was fully human and never sinned.   God could have created a much better person than myself, one who always chose the right thing, yet he created me instead, despite my flaws.  He proves he loves me as I am, continually drawing me towards perfection.  For whatever purpose he has for me, he has confidence that I will accomplish it.  If I ask God to repeat his miraculous creation of the mother of his son, where will that leave me? Joe Moore

That doesn't meant that I >think all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the >evidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things. If you are referring to the terms "effeminate" and "homosexuals" in the above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged.  However, I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an "incredibly perverse" interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse. Therefore I do not believe it is "incredibly perverse" to read it in this way. >I think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why is >homosexuality wrong?  Because it's fornication.  Why is it >fornication?  Because they're not married.  Why aren't they married? >Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony. Why does the >church refuse to do a marriage ceremony?

After all, a couple doesn't have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the peace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to "save themselves" for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position.  So what is the gay view? - Mark [Yes, I agree that a reasonable person might conclude that Paul is condemning homosexuality.  I was responding to certain details of your posting.

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network. Ignore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time of arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged, one can often get positions down to ~arc minutes. BTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the fairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1 ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing and t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the order of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the wrong direction.

I submit God did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose  to follow the bad report of the 10 spies over Joshua and Caleb.

At least to me it seems there was/is an age, or point in maturity where  they were/are held responsible, and could not enter the "Promised Land",  younger ones were not held to the same "rules", at least not by God. | "Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him." | | "Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit."  | | (proverbs 26:4&5)

The degree of elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.  As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.  Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with CAH needs to be treated. ====================================== Howard Doyle

>>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the >>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse. > It is >absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do* >raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human >adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant >than the laws of kashrut.

Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are topically aranged together in the law.  This is very important. Anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality deals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there is no proof for this.)  If the Law reveals the character of God, and  is "holy, just, and good" as is written in the New Testament, then those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts to be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture.   Why must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human adult relationships?  Isn't that bordering on sophistry?  The point we are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts. Not everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors. The issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.   I do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a member of the same sex.  I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is  the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after. So other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation.  And the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships between adult humans is red herring.  We all agree that it is okay  for adults to  have caring relationships with one another.

Talking about car alarms, there are certain cars in this country that are  only insurable if they are fitted with a Vecta alarm. We're talking Coswoths and Porsches and stuff. Just before they (the insurance companies) decided to  make this move, they insisted that the car be fitted with a Scorpion alarm ( now they've changed to the Vecta)... so everyone who's spent $$$ on fitting  the Scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the Vecta system.

There were  	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology 	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'     One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography     is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the     hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic     or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's     City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research      named A. J. Ellison.     After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison     came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we     calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of     the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than     'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing     in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited     value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and     magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be     of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and     usually also tracer chemicals. 					kind regards, 					todd +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Digital Equipment Corporation		             (215) 542-3573           | | Philadelphia, Pa.

Items for sale..... This package was bought throught a award give-away company. I attempted to cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late and the company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truth which I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as close as possible. Here is the describtion of the package... Nishika 3D camera	It takes very good picture, never been opended 			or used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring 			case, film, and a instruction video. It has four 			lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm 			film. Jewelry			It came with the package as additional gift. Bahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport. 			The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person 			per-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is 			_not_ included. Las Vegas, Reno, Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare, and 				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights. 				Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not 				included. The voucher is good for all 3 				locations, but you can't travel to all 3 				places at once. Cancun, Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel 			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and 			ground transfer, hotel tax is not included as 			usual. I paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you make your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell the whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation vouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric If you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift. If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards.  Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is  only one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them  back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper  price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three  months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit  card company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price. If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning. More details could be given if you wish. Douglas Kou Hiram College
>I heard that a certain disease (toxoplasmosys?) is transmitted by cats which >can harm the unborn fetus. Does anybody know about it? Is it a problem to  >have a cat in the same apartment? The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis.  It is a protozoan that  lives and multiplies within cells.  In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic after the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness and mental retardation. Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.  In addition, whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling anything else, especially food. Information came from _The Merck Manual, 15th Ed._ I hope this information is helpful to you. Elisa

Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or whatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an antihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip up and eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell you what to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms, then fine, otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs the NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing up for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off it the side-effects were because it was new.  OK, fine - but it has passed the safety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to take the risk to have quality of life now.  The only alternatives I have is to get it prescribed privately, which I cannot afford, or to pay a private allergy specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid.  I am fairly certain I am allergic to more than one chemical additive, as a lot of things I can't eat have nothing in common except things I know are safe, so testing myself isn't really an option; there are too many permutations. > I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.

Yes, I've noticed that - and I can work it up by eating just under the tolerance level fairly regularly.  If I don't eat anything except home cooking for a month or so I lose it and have to work it up from scratch... a bad experience.  Now I know what the early-warning symptoms are, though, I can usually tell whether I am allergic to food before I've eaten too much of it... usually...

------------------------- Original Article ------------------------- The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G. type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph, and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows. The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess... (The title was the only thing they changed/added) "Gun Stats" The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley, author of "Armed and Female."  The article, in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The article states, "A study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder."  This is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons, outlined below: The study gives the impression that, if you own a gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you.  The study, however, fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe- trator. The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every month, the second your grandmother cashes her social security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a friend. The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample size (396), taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used, successfully, by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means, or who offer no resistance at all. Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. D.F.

>If you put a locking lugnut on your tires, do you need to have your >tires rebalanced?? > >John Mas > > > Well, it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have.  My previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others.  The locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was supposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking nut.  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no one ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  Unfortunately, I found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid of the locking nuts. :-( My present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn.  They have been made to be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the package and I verified it myself).  I haven't had any vibration problems with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  I did have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire balancing. Tom
I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs were definitely involved.  My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate medications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With the help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication discontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug. Two days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions. I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe that, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces the chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care providers can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those circumstances.  I grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless, I suggest you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL at all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have been prescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because the hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly. Just my opinion, -Larry (obviously not a doc) C.

: Ok, a few days back, the below-included message was posted stating:  :  : >     I believe with everything in my heart that on May 3, 1993, the city of : >Portland, Oregon in the country of the United States of America will be hit : >with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake... :  : By now, we know that this did not come to pass.... :  : ...I don't think it's particularly  : glorifying to God to say things like "Well, I THINK the Lord is telling me...",  : ..Such statements seem to me to be an attempt to get a spiritual thrill should  : the guess happen to come true, without risking the guilt of false prophecy  : should it fail to come to pass.  I do not believe genuine prophecy was ever  : like this.  Comments? :  I agree.   People should not be misled to believe "thus sayeth the Lord" by innuendo or opinion or speculation. Speak directly.  If the Lord has given you something to say, say it. But, before I declare "thus sayeth the Lord", I'd better know for certain without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely certain, again, without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers. Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous.  For me, my greatest fears in this area would be the following: 1--that the people would be misled 2--that people would lose respect for christianity 3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies 4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word,    my calling would be lost forever.  God's Word would command the people    never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet.  My    bridges would be burnt forever.  Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but    I could never again be a prophet of God. In the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak and that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the world of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate, cowardly silence or by our false statements.  And because of this, it is critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, and in prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference. In this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging one another, claiming "rights" that are not theirs, denying rights that do indeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the "gods" of this world, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel good. It's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in contrast against this backdrop of falsehood.  When we say, "thus sayeth the Lord", it happens.  When we pray, prayer is answered because we prayed right. When we say we're christians, we really mean it.

I was making the point tha >there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if >there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types >of common incidents. Saying "hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y" is *much* different from saying "hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y." Here you've made both statements. If the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy X, then perhaps policy X is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement is not something to base policy decisions on! > Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children >ages 14 and under. According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (formerly the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change, don't you think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the "leading causes of unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death.

Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  I'm sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern, but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one. The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking. >>Please explain why you think "symbolic offerings" do good. >> > My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police >departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by >giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond >to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.

I thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on all these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to "interpersonal violence." >>I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these "statistics" - I >>suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of >>students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun) >>to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students >>who carry a gun to school daily. >> > Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence What, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL METHODS per year?

Ah, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People 2000 document is to "enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?"  The agency that funded the "study" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban had saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings? It wasn't their fault that the population of DC dropped in their "post law" period... >  If YOU look carefully you will see >that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. >The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that >400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.

What's this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary school I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a problem?  I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the car, the knives, the oven, and the tools.

> "  A well regulated militia, being necessarry to the security of a free state, >   the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." > >  What is regulated? Regulated means "controlled"! How about security? While it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789. Moreover, "controlled" doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling. Fletcher's Political Works, pub'd in 1749, defines a "well-regulated militia", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people NOT under the control of govt.  The wigged gents who argued about the constituion used it in that way. Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than "individual right, not to be interfered with by govt". Note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on govt military power.  See Scarry's University of Penn law review article for an extended discussion.  The existence of a well-regulated militia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient. -andy --

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the  dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed  legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that the odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer, and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo  was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must  be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage  of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is  affixed to the door frame of the vehicle.  Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search (which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

Of that, a  substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry burn and the reserve.  So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going mass.  If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I'll be interested.

[...] >apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which >we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, >op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* >gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one. I'm afraid that I cannot find this portrayal in _EH_.  I don't see anywhere in 3:32:7-8 where Eusebius mentions that certain  gnostics had the wrong gnosis. The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus' statements,  "...whilst if there were any at all, that attempted to pervert  the sound doctrine of the saving gospel, they were yet skulking  in dark retreats..." >Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I >don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I >believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of >early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today. "Favorably interpreted?" Just in looking at two of the four  references that you gave (I have the _EH_ handy, Irenaeus and the  _Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for) I see no room for  such 'interpretations.' And any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to  the Temple Ceremonies.  The links for Jay's using _EH_ for support are: "imparting the gift  of knowledge" = "imparted secret information" = "being given secret  signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven."  But there is not enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call  this "favorable interpretation."  It appears to be closer to  "fabrication." ============================= Robert Weiss

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms. (To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.) On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.) I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or another.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the one who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest route, and so I am happy with it. Russell
So if Potvin can pound on Dino, what happens when Dino pounds  on him?  If Dino gets his legs slashed, can he slash Potvin in return?  This year at a UM-LSSU hockey game, a UM player was called for a slash when he hit the goalie's glove with his stick.  Is that slashing, while hitting someone's ankles isn't?  How do the refs know what to call?  Do the goalies get more liberties than other players? 				Brad
>[There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage >you quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that >"homosexual" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to >have a meaning like homosexual prostitute.   From what I understand of my experience in looking up this word, and  discussing it with a Greek-literate individual, the meaning of the  word is rather clear.  Basically it literally means "he who beds with a man" or "he who has sex with a man."  The burden of proof is on the  pro-homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word has an  idiomatic meaning nor evident from its literal meaning.  One can speculate all day long that it might mean something else, but we need evidence before we create new doctrines, and get rid of the historical understanding of the meaning of this word. Link Hudson. [I've read enough discussions of this passage, in both liberal and conservative sources, to be sure that the meaning -- even the literal meaning -- is not certain.  That doesn't mean one can't come to some conclusion, nor does it mean that I think there's any doubt about what Paul thinks of homosexuality.  But there are plausible arguments for a couple of different meanings.  --clh]

Point 1: I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole "yeast issue" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon", necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully cognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  For the situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word, and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic". It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional "difficult" patient. Point 2: I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it follows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from a treatment point-of-view. And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where "standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying intent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the patient should come first when considering treatment. What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them. This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion. Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real difficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure "scientific" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with and by the "scientific" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.

It's over - the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 6-5 tonight to sweep the series. A beautiful goal by Brad May (Lafontaine set him up while lying down on the ice) ended it. Fuhr left the game game with an injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well; however, the Sabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem. Montreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to be headed for Game 7. The Habs dominated the first two periods and were unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. However, an early goal by Brunet in the 3rd won it. The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray Ferraro 4-3; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the 2nd. The Isles' all-time playoff OT record is now 28-7. - Vlad the Impaler

There's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping mall, offering free examinations.  Part of the process involves a multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer- sounding voice "digitize left PSIS" "digitize right PSIS" "digitize C7" "please stand with spine in neutral position".  I'm wondering whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voice is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring something that chiropractors think is useful to measure. --  "Ya can talk all ya wanna, but it's dif'rent than it was!"

Personally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the timing.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything "new" that happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were going to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't it be more "reasonable" to believe the BD's would set the fire early after the assault began?   The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting of the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because I was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter (watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously. Specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been  penetrating a few feet. reserving judgement, -Aaron

: Bowman is the genius...Johnson isn't.  Bowman is a great coach...Johnson, : a very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and : Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and : delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is : a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.   IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at  this time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his  group of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in  Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one.  (Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the  change.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this  year, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the  other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players  to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both  of which came at exactly the right time.  Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach  for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can  you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway?  Playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also  keeps the egos in check.  Just a couple of ideas. -- _____________________________________________________________________________ Tom Huot        			        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

However, that does not imply that she was just as subject to sin as we are.  Catholic doctrine says that man's nature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16). In that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully human than any of the rest of us.    You ask why God cannot "repeat the miracle" of Mary's preservation from Original Sin.  A better way to phrase it would be "why _did_ He not" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation was obtained.  Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtained through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.  However, as God is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to apply His Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before Christ came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective.  Therefore, Christ's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and were necessary even for Mary's salvation. -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University

Some of what I would complain about >is rooted in aesthetics.  >Regards,  >Wm. Hathaway  >Baltimore MD  Mr. Hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy.  In short, an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on the Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why there are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky. Regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they are more like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beer can somebody had thrown on the side of the road: just trash. _____________ Dale M.

Okay, here is the result of my efforts.  I'm just getting started with this type of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low. Comments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed. **************************************************************************** Editor,  I would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to the "right to keep and bear arms", and to a greater degree, the many other "rights" that we take for granted on a daily basis.  1.	You're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  You call the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while you are waiting for the police to arive?  2.	You are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A "good samaritan" stops to "help", when you find you and your family at gun-point or knife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family?  3.	You are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears suddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you strong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape you in order to survive the attack?  If the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep and bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to defend yourself and your family?  Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If certain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law enforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition for use in your handgun.  There is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened? Our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time, or in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while waiting for help to arrive.  There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit the sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  One elected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment!  I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected officials decided that they should only belong to a "certain church", or go to church on a "partiular day"?  What if you were told that you could only read certain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the right to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful manner?  These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments. If we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fight for the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your life is affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights by defending your Second Amendment rights.

I'm wondering if "vandalize" is the proper word to use in this situation.  My dictionary defines "vandalism" as "the willful or malicious destructuion of  public or private property, especially of anything beautiful or artisitc." I would agree the sky is beautiful, but not that it is public or private property. I personally prefer natural skies, far from city lights and sans aircraft.   However, there is also something to be said for being able to look up into the sky and see a satellite.  Many people get a real kick out of it, especially if they haven't seen one before.    --  		    "Find a way or make one." 	             -attributed to Hannibal
My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses.  I have a very deviated nasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures). One side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow.  Of course I have known this for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection, discovered during an MRI after a severe migraine.  A CT scan subsequently  confirmed the problems in the sinuses. He wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid, along with nasal septoplasty. He explained the procedure, and the risks.  What I would like to know is if there is anyone out there who can tell me "I had this surgery, and it helped me"? (I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't really help them). I am a moderately severe asthmatic.  ENT doc says large percentage see some relief of their asthma after sinus surgery.  Also he said it is not unheard of that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved. I am 42. Any relevant information is appreciated. Regards, Jay Keller Sunnyvale, California
Astronomy & Space magazine's UK telephone newsline carries the times to see the Russian Space Station Mir which will be visible every EVENING (some time between 9 o'clock and midnight) from April 27 to May 7. It's about as bright as Jupiter at its best. There are two cosmonuats on board. For the time to watch, tel. 0891-88-19-50 (48p/min peak 36p/min all other times, but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a few pence). E-mail reports of sightings would be appreciated: give lat/long and UT (a few seconds accuracy if possible) when it passes ABOVE or BELOW any bright star (say brighter than mag. 3), planet or Moon. With Moon in evening sky also, note that from somewhere in U.K. Mir will pass in front of the Moon each night! Please alert local clubs to the telephone newsline, and general public as Mir can cause quite a stir! -Tony Ryan, "Astronomy & Space", new International magazine, available from:               Astronomy Ireland, P.O.Box 2888, Dublin 1, Ireland. 6 issues (one year sub.): UK 10.00 pounds, US$20 surface (add US$8 airmail).

There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are. That's bullshit. Anyone who would follow the Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. But to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fan.A  true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team. When I visit PIttsburgh, I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think the management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds. Lert's say the Pens start doing to their own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have done in recent years, I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team. I'll still follow it and bitch about it. But I won't waste my money on mediocre teams. -P{ravin Ratnam
>>The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year. >>Yes, I'd rather have SC cover it, just for the amount of coverage. >> >So this year you had a game on SCNY, a game on SCA, a game on ESPN, >and if the Rangers hadn't crashed and burned, you would have had a >game on MSG.  What are you complaining about? The problem is that (by no fault of ESPN) ongoing games are not covered 'til the final horn sounds.  With two channels, SCNY and SCA, late-finishing games (up to Pacific time) and overtimes elsewhere will kick in at the end of local coverage.  If SCNY is blocked by the Mets, there is still some hockey on SCA (SCNY Plus). With an ESPN 2, the current situation would be alleviated. gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L. Dare

(In the fifth, the finnish goalie,  Ketterer was elected the best Finn) Has this to do with the goalies  having good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy scorers??? Anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally (the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy).  It looks like the goalies are getting too good.  Is this due to their equipment getting bigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger now than they were some years ago).

That's interesting, as I was always of the opinion that people dumb enough to keep a monarchy around and support them with tax funds when said monarchy is merely a figurehead deserve all that they get.  Dunkirk, for example.  What?  That has nothing to do with it? Then enjoy your helping of foot. >Anyway, he killed a few feds 	And they killed a few people of their own, including one child at last report.  So what?  Being a federal agent is not license to kill. Then there's CNN indicating that the ATF/FBI actually *DID* start the fires which would mean feds killed just under 100 people.

This is sci.med, not alt.sex. Secondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that "American's are just too hung up on the penis....blah,blah".  I think most American's don't care about anything so comlicated as that.  They just think it "looks nicer".  Ask  a few of them and see what response you get.  Others still opt for circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  Some think it is easier to clean.  Still others do it because "Daddy was". Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality.  My son is not circumcised, and I can vouch for the argument that it is more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'.  Not so much that the foreskin is difficult to pull back (it isn't) but because my son doesn't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplaced feces.  So, many times it just gets a once over dab.  It worries me that he might get an infection due to his lack of cooperation.  I am sure, however, that he will be able to handle cleaning under the foreskin himself once he is old enough.  Until, there is always the decision at each diaper change...is this the time to clean or can we wait till next time.

Or that Koresh was any actual threat to you and the rest of the  US?  Haven't you ever stopped to wonder WHY the government raided this farm? This raid was NOT ABOUT RELIGION, SEX, OR CHILD ABUSE.  To the best available evidence at the moment, this raid, psychological torture, and group death was  about Koresh's failure to PAY A $200 TAX on ONE grenade launcher that he may  or may not even have had!  That's why it was the BATF doing the raiding in the first place. Do you think a $200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government with 100 armed men in trailers, orchestrated character assassination, noise torture, and a holocaust? > I am however sad to hear of the death of any  > child unlike the sick bastard I supposedly am.

The play can be found in the book FOUR SACRED PLAYS, and also in various other collections, including one called RELIGIOUS DRAMA (Meridian Books) and one called BEST PLAYS OF 1937. Third is the book MERE CHRISTIANITY by C S Lewis, particularly the last section, called "Beyond Personality". Fourth is a book called THEOLOGY FOR BEGINNERS, by the Roman Catholic writer Frank Sheed.

In response to alleged circular reasoning concerning the morality of       homosexuality, clh poses the following challenge: >In order to break the circle there's got to be some other >reason to think homosexuality is wrong. I answer, The circle is simple to break.   The Church teaches that homosexual behavior is immoral.  This teaching is raw, impassionate, unassailable dogma.  That closes the argument for me. --  Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock  Catechist [Right.  I understand that people have other reasons for not accepting homosexuality.  The point I was making was that the specific argument given wouldn't stand on its own.  --clh]

He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate >drugs... No wonder he became confused!  With so many drugs, it is almost impossible to know which one is causing the problem.  And because some drugs  potentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects all the worse, and even dangerous.  (kinda like mixing alcohol and  antihistamines!) >...he was disoriened [the doctors thougt ] they should put him on something >else as well! Unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of the drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes the patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug. This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs at home!!!! >....procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss >it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL >at all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have been >prescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because the >hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly. I fully agree.  In addition, she proably should be examined by another doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking. I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during a lecture, but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physician is unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone  book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology,  or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society. By finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.

In my opinion, the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever done. Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met: 1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is some number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number) 2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver was drunk) 3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal to regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever happening). You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can still sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited tort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In exchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save $150/year. Unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse people so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort. I guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurance companies would be pushing harder for repeal.

>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but >what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33. It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer Cd.  To calculate drag use this formula: D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3), V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure (a fancy aero term for air pressure or force).  Note that power is: P = F * v Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v is velocity (ft/s).  Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd.  So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare) 101 mph Sorry to dissappoint. --  Al Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  'blad  Iaido  NASA "Well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?"                                              -Mary Chapin-Carpenter

(These  are not, by the way, "extra" heartbeats.  This is how they feel, and  this is how I described them initially to the doctor, but they're  actually *premature* heartbeats.  I would sometimes experience a lapse  after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time,  making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.)  I had them persistently for eighteen years.  Then I went on a low-fat  diet, and they just stopped.  I haven't had a single episode of PVH  for almost two years.  I know:  correlation does not imply causation.  This is just FWIW.   --Barbara 
My sig has generated more mail than any of my posts. Robin Hood is a school financing plan wherein property rich school districts will have a portion of their tax revenue taken from them and given to property poor districts.  The laudable plan is to equalize the per student spending.  IMHO, however, it is a disaster waiting to happen.  Taxes will go up in 50% of the districts and we will lose control of how OUR tax money is spent.  It penalizes districts that have excelled. And the election is Saturday. Along with city council, school board and the unfinished Senate term.  And after I exercise one right, I'm going to exercise another! -- Dillon Pyron                      | The opinions expressed are those of the TI/DSEG Lewisville VAX Support    | sender unless otherwise stated.

Post all you want, foreigner.  We'd rather hear from you than those "I'll support the fascist who writes the hecks for my salary" .edu site types! Should you expect the Police to come in and assault you, lay siege and refuse to help when they (yes, let's give them the benefit of the doubt) accidently burn down your ranch home?  Even though ey have emergency vehicles nearby? Is this a proper response when you just keep to yourself? Even if you DON'T hurt anyone?  And you 're cooperative with cops when you occasionally come out? I hope not. .

An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and never will have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying Wood is.  The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against Los Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his arm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the head. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one right between the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble. The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even then he'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-) 								Alan

I'm looking to buy the annual Playboy magazine  issue featuring girls from colleges around the US. Specificly, I want issues from 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. One of these features a girl I went to high school with, so I'm curious to see how it turned out. All help is appreciated.

My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that I am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might be able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below, please e-mail or post! 1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,    there is usually a loud "thunk" from the rear of    of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.    What could cause this?  Is the differential going    bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,    and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,    the sound is NOT something rolling around in the    trunk!)   2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from    the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves    going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the    valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped? 3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable    with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is    relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to    the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel    spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes    might help -- could anything else cause this? 4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting    worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from    3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more    recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.    Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put    through all the gears and then back to park, as per    Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark. 5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have    4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps    in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are    they to change?  Can they be reconditioned? I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners out there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly, these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted into taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be junked.  About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and Impalas (& Broughams). --  Andrew White

Stay away from GEICO.  A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free  laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit  enforcement.  The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket  your premium will increase dramatically based on how much "over the  limit" you were.  If I remember correctly, at "more than 20 over",  you'll get something like a 65% increase.   If you have a radar detector, you will be denied coverage or dropped  immediately.   One accident claim and you will be dropped.  After many years with GEICO, my father who had 0 tickets and had made  0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim.  He was dropped   immediately.  Since then he has been with State Farm for years with  no complaints.  I have been with State Farm for about 20 years - no complaints.  TRAVIS
In the videos of the original BATF attack on the BD church, did anyone happen to see BATF agents on the highest structure, where Koresh's room was? I don't recall seeing BATF agents higher than the roof of the lowest structures, so I made an assumption that BATF helos did the firing down into the tower. Any other info on how the rounds came through the roof?

  Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more bare-bones. In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike, maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it in. After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed. So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all the difference. So, on to the substance. The question was  Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass? Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last part first. This is to the best of my recollection what he said. As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers  about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point. So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that  they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own. Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually, this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are trying to do something with it.   Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?                     John.
Who is Ram Das? According to his brochures, he is a.k.a. Richard Alpert, PhD, and is somehow associated with the:   Seva Foundation   8 N. San Pedro Road   San Rafael, CA  94903 and the:   Hanuman Foundation    524 San Anselmo Ave #203   San Anselmo, CA  94960 He speaks publically on such topics as "Consciousness & Current Events," and has written some books and recorded some tapes on  similar subjects.   Why do I care?  My wife wants to go to one of his lectures.  When I asked why, she said Ram Das was "the greatest spiritual leader of our time!" Several years ago my wife got involved with a religious cult, and we went through 9 months of hell that almost ended our marriage  before she quit.  Let's just say I'm concerned about this Ram Das and her interest, especially so with the recent religious cult events from Texas.  I need information - solid and real - so I  know what I'm dealing with. If you have any information about Ram Das or the organizations  shown above, I would be very interested in your correspondence. Thank you!   -- Scott Roleson [The dictionary of cults that I use classifies this as "new age", with a basically Hindu orientation.  The headquarters is (or was when this was written) at that Lama Foundation, which they identify as a "New Age Commune" in San Cristobel, New Mexico.  For information you might read Alpert's books, which they list as "Be Here Now" (an autobiography), "The Only Dance There is", and "Grist for the Mill". It is dealt with briefly in a citation given as "Larson, New Book, pp 339-41". I assume this is Bob Larson, "Larson's New Book of Cults". I'd warn you however that the whole approach to the "new age" is controversial.  Sources such as the reference book I used, as well as Bob Larson, believe in a Satanic new age conspiracy, which some regard as hysterical.  However at the very least, it seems clear that this is not a Christian group.  --clh]

Shaz, Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:   There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.   initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start   your car. The computer will actually "sense" how you drive your car and   as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and   then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go   on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.      After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the   computer starts counting again. So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will  come on and the yellow and red lights will go off. I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator. It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a  surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil. Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed. PS.  my initial question is "how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW" Derek

Doing this in anything like reasonable time would require more propulsion capability than we can manage.  You would have to boost to Pluto and then slow back down.  You could do something like a Hohman orbit, but I think that would take ridiculous amounts of time (my Rubber Bible is at home). --  "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While I don't have an answer for you, I reckon Blaise Pascal is generally credited with inventing the syringe per se.  I don't know much about the needles; however, I do know of a southwest Virginia country doctor who some thrity or more years ago invented, patented, used, and sold a syringe/ hypodermic needle combination that retracted, injected with the flip of a trigger, then retracted, giving a near-painless injection.  The fellow was Dr. Daniel Gabriel, and it was termed the Gabriel--somebody else syringe.  Did you come across that one.  (Plastic, disposable syringes came onto the market about that time and his product went by the wayside, to my knowledge.)

I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton. Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed to concern the Oiler's future. Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference, Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium. Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier, but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington. As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if the team does move, there is no place more deserving than Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of Bettman?

The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in any way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows everything that is going to happen to us.  We have free will, and are able to change what happens to us.  However, since God knows everything, He knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (God is not subject to time).  Too often arguments pit predestination against free will.  We believe in both. -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University

Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ... >"As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have >a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some >of our customers about that.  As far as commercialization, that is >a long ways off.  ... > Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this >threaten further work on DC-? ?       Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time.  A good reference on this might be: "Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92- 0639)." by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane    The design (the concept is also called "Beta") as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support.  System design reliability is .9995.    Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage.    To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans, modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets, would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.    Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225. The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin, with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.      The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier, cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude "In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self- ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable."    >Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?    Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.    Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government's future space transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the "4-2-3" architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types, etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against the investment and risk of going to "leap frog" new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.    It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor    --- Maximus 2.01wb

     I used to drive a truck a few years back. I once rode with an old codger that had been driving for about 30 yrs. The only time he would use the clutch was to get the truck moving. He could shift that 13 speed lightning quick, up or down, without the slightest rake of a gear. He was as smooth as silk. It was the most amazing shifting demonstration I've ever seen! Having said all that I  still don't know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a clutch? Why do it?

I don't think so, not from what I heard. He lived >ONE DAY of suffering and died. If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then >JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE? This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understood the trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But, at the same time, he is God's son "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could he really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost "planted the seed" in Mary, so to speak, then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the human father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's  qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that case, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship isn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God incarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God manifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us?  Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid to redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body may have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more. The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my sincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ. But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.   [Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together. First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense, with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that terrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin Birth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn't imply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means the only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material. Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a Trinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is a part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth. Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn't specifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Son who was incarnated. --clh]

A really sad op-ed appeared in my school's newpaper today.  It claimed that full-auto weapons are illegal in the U.S. I understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before May 19, 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states.  Is Texas one of those states? Can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been  killed by legal full-auto weapons in the U.S.? And finally, I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest of facts on the Waco incident.  In particular, I would like a source for the FBI/BATF mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab, and information on the beginning of the raid, specifically BATF lies. I am also interested in past BATF no-knock warrents which have lead to personal and property damage against innocent citizens. I intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon.

Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of guns.

Marhaba Nabil, If we posit two minds in Christ, the mind of the logos and the mind of the human Jesus, then we must admit two wills.  A mind is not a mind without a will.  I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there is a philosophical problem here that should examined. T. V. Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this:       _____________		      (Mind of Logos)      (	 _______   )      (	(	)  )	Here, the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the      (	( Human	)  )	Son.

This       (	(_______)  )	explains why Jesus said even he did not know the       (_____________)	time of the kingdom.	 The human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free human decision.  But if the human will would have decided differently than what was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never the case. He employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind theory.  The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing yourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient.   The one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.  Agreed.  But I am still waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two minds making two persons.  Christian analytic philosophers are breaking new ground in explicating the rationality of Theism and the Incarnation.  ====================================           University of Georgia, Athens Institute of Higher Ed.  [Note that "person" is being used in a more abstact sense here than the English.  We connect person with personality and other things that are human attributes.  I'm not entirely sure whether I'd want to apply personality to God, but if it is appropriate, then I think we'd have to say that Christ had two personalities.  --clh]
The cited passages are covered IN DEPTH in a FAQ for this group. That particular FAQ (I've forgotten the author) discusses the traditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and indicates which points have strong textual support. Perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for retrieving the FAQ on this topic? BTW, this issue, while dealt with before, is VERY timely.  One of the major Presbyterian churches in California (St. Andrews -- a  MegaChurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of  Synod (amounts to about 10% of the budget of the Synod, which  covers all of Southern CA and Hawaii) until support for a  pro-homosexual lobbying group (the Lazarus Project) is terminated. [This came from a news report on CNN yesterday -- corrections welcome.] 					Tim [I think it's time for me to post the FAQ.   This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church.  On the other side, one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining homosexual elders, and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do so.  And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said they couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an "evangelist".  These situations, as well as the one you describe, do not appear to be stable.  This will certainly be a major topic for the General Assembly next month.  If the church can't come up with a solution that will let people live with each other, I think we're end up with a split.  Clearly neither side wants that, but I think we'll get pushed into it by actions of both sides. --clh]
Organization: [via International Space University] A young French skeptic, who reads (skeptically) the UFO review OVNI Presence (O.P.), sent me the following excerpt from an August 92 issue of this review (R.G. = Robert Galley, French minister of defense in 1974, answering about the Belgian UFO wave): "O.P. : Can you conceive that the U.S. could allow themselves to send  their most modern crafts over foreign territory, with the Belgian  hierarchy ignoring that ?" "R.G. : Absolutely ! The best proof which I can give is that, some time  ago, without informing the French authorities, the U.S. based in  Germany sent a plane to make photos of Pierrelatte (*). We followed  this plane, and, after its landing on the Ramstein airport, Colonel X  got back the shots of Pierrelatte. The U.S. had not informed us..." (*) There is an important military plant of enrichment of uranium at Pierrelatte (Drome). What kind of plane could it be ? Surely not an SR-71, which our planes could not follow (and still can't)...

The problem with your approach is they add up what you can reasonably claim as 'spin-offs', add up what's been spent on space, and then come back with something like, "You spent $X billion for that?  Wouldn't it be better just to spend the money on direct research and forget all this space stuff?  We could have got all that stuff a *lot* cheaper that way.  Space is wasteful and inefficient."

Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year: They both won their division, they had close to the same number of points, they both went down 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in 7 games, and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat, with less talent.

Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems: First, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it, the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular, if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food, food occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction. Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying, and causes frequent discomfort. My doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using the following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so, was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this, especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation, reaction to anesthesia). The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number of "extra" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24 hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this, however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was "normal". It certainly doesn't feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or caffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don't want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something as simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying down for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the same time. Thanks for any help/advice! =============================================================================== ===============================================================================
(This is a cross post to rec.gardens and sci.med. Set the follow-up (line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, or I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice on how to repel wasps.    This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else.    Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem to come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath. Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me, and come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and close all doors and windows.  NB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.

It is nothing >more that an anti-Catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there >were protestants.  Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious. I have not seen this book, though I have had several people quote it in  support of some tendentious assertions they were making, so I have become  curious about it. I don't want to malign this Hislop fellow, whoever he may be, as I have only  heard the arguments at second hand, but both of the arguments seemed to turn  on false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop. I would be interested in knowing more about these things.  The first one claimed that the word "church" was derived from the Greek  "cyclos", and that it was therefore related to the worship of "Circe". I don't know if Hislop is the source of this assertion, but it does seem to  be based on false etymology. The second claimed an etymological relationship between "Ishtar" and  "Easter", which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some  of the wilder notions of the British Israelites. Regarding the latter, as far as I have been able to find out, "Easter" is  derived from the old English name for April - "Eosturmonath". The Venerable  Bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called "Eostre", but  apart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more  about her. It also seems that the term "Easter" is only used by the English  and those they evangelized. The Germans, for example, also use the term  "Ostern", but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries. So I would be interested in any evidence of "Easter" being used for Pascha  by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo- Saxons and their offshoots. Such evidence might support the claims of those  who appear to derive the theory from Hislop. ============================================================ Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial Department Univ. of South Africa, P.O.

I would like to see his reasoning behind this.  You may have gotten  "burned" by natural disaster prophecies down there, but that does not mean that every natural disaster/judgement prophecy is false.  Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious that judgement prophecies can be valid.  here in the US, it seems like we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies, though I am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement. Sometimes God does give words that are difficult to swallow.  The relative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to dismiss it.  Much of the OT is not happy stuff. Link Hudson.

In addition, there is one school of thought that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen.   As far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be one of the most intensely scrutinized. An excellent recent review of the topic can be found in:  	Vermeulen, Bessems and Van de Straat. 	 	Molecular Aspects of Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and its 	Mechanism-Based Prevention. Drug Metabolism Reviews, 24(3) 367- 	407 (1992). 	(Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe) I couldn't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic dose of acetaminophen causes.  I've heard a number of descriptions by physicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe a lingering very painful death.  -Gary-

A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, a cyst on one kidney, and a kidney infection.  She was upset because her condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all this time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents' HMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney. When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views, but she says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  She is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she got worried. 	Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her and that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April... She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go to classes.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans to call back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to these questions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.  She does plan to get a second opinion, too.  	I will pass info on to her.  It never hurts to get information from more than one source.   You can e-mail me or post. Thanks. Alice

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2 & 3.  Buying a car at  "dealer's cost" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a  kickback from the bank. Blue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average  retail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself,  try to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok. Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends. c. b. fowler  gtri/esml
   On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.    To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:    1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and    anachronisms.    2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices    which are at variance with sacred Scripture.    3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of    subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.    4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine    Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and    poetic and religious feeling. First, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highly subjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book of the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesn't, on some issues, in some way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests. Second, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of their composition.  I don't recall the exact dating of all of the books, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the canonical books (i.e. Daniel). Furthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been originally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in nature.  Both of these features probably figured heavily in the rejection of these books from the various canons. These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to judge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have shown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely objective standards for determining canonicity.

Sounds pretty familiar.  I posted similar cries about last September when Caroline just entered daycare.  She was two, then, and have been with  continuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches, her colds slowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds. Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she had antibiotics.  (The other time was due to sinus infection, and I wished that I did not give her that awful Septra.)  >Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?

Caroline will get more and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other  kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily. However, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these diseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold, we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp  at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net). That's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her off antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would have antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she fought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if the child is in pain and/or high fever.  >does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it >not have any long term effect?

This is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with the status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue predates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the "deuteroncanonicals" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put them after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the Hebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he reports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just dictating his translation to an amanuensis. That is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in Western Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the first steps in "reducing" these books from the status they had (and have) among the Greeks. Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers "threw out" these books.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome had already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should not be based on citations from these ALONE. I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as part of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek) are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow "more inspired" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable -- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in Greek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a big boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current "inerrancy" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is surely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of course, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it would seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the Hebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative. BTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of translation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome, above) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two of four have been published so far. --  Michael L.

I would add 4': our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all people to certain standards of sexual behavior.

Of course, this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage, and we couldn't have that! :-) billh

One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this one, too).   While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into position. If you do it right, the car won't jump backward, nor will the gears grind.... You will just glide back. -sam

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer. Here are the individual goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993 These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those are not verified.  These stats are available by mail every weekday and sometimes on weekends, if I'm in town and I can get late game results.  Just send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

>If this idea goes through, it's the thin end of the wedge.  Soon >companies will be doing larger, and more permanant, billboards in the >sky.  I wouldn't want a world a few decades from now when the sky >looks like Las Vegas.  That would _really_ make me sad. Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By  the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas,  the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as 5000 kg in a Low Earth "advertising" orbit: Very roughly the same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were to become common place, that would have to be a very low price... The night sky on a Lunar backpacking trip would still be very  pristine...  There's always been a problem of having to get  away from civilization before you can really find "natural" scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still "wild." While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of  growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will not save your view of the night sky, because by the time  such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_ the stars... >Coca Cola company will want to paint the moon red and white.  (Well, >if not this moon, then a moon of Jupiter)...   An ad on a moon of Jupiter would be rather pointless, since you need a telescope to see them. However, I'd love to see them get all the publicity they could from underwritting the "Coca Cola Io Orbital Mapping Probe."   >...Microscum will want to >name a galaxy `Microscum Galaxy'. They already can, to some extent: The IAU allows names derived from sponsors or patrons of scientific research. If Microscum donates money to a university astronomy program, one of the galactic  astronomers could easily get a newly discovered galaxy named after them.

But to add to this explaniation, each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe, just so the detector does not read the background radiation(i.e. cosmic rays),  if I remember right, the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the  background.  This is so they don't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays that would normally set it off. Even with this buffer, they still have to throw out something like 1/2 of the bursts that they DO get, because of the Earth's Van Allen Belts, the South Atlantic Anomaly, the Sun,  if I remember right, there is either a radar station, or a radio station in Australia, and there are a couple other sources as well.                                                   -jeremy
I am looking for a copy of the first World Wrestling Federation album in Record format.  Will pay $10 for a good condition record and original album jacket and inserts.  The album I am looking for has a picture of a bunch of the wrestlers ina recording studio front and back with the good guy wrestlers and the bad guy wrestlers making faces at each other. Songs include 'Land of a thousand dances" or something like that. on the header.

In short, it is permissable to bash Fundamentalists. >No need to substitue a nationality such as "Mexican..." try simply to  >substitute a different religion "...raised by Muslim parents," or "...raised >by Jewish parents..."  The paper simply would not do this. I have noticed that newspapers don't even know what a fundamentalist is; at the least, they confuse new evangelicals and fundamentalists.  In this news group, the liberals don't even know what a fundamentalist is (crying out "legalist" at anyone who believes and obeys God's Word). A fundamentalist would train their children in the way God proscribes, not in the way that man proscribes.  This would not include life threatening beatings but would include corporal punishment.  To the liberals, I cry out infidel at anyone who does not believe God's Word. Signature follows: "Your statutes are wonderful: therefore I obey them."  Psalm 119:129 ========================================================================= David L. Hanson Any opinions expressed are my own! [As most people here know, I believe fundamentalist is sufficiently ill-defined that I advise using some more specific term.  I think many people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of related concepts (e.g. denial of evolution).  While the original fundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, I would think most people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original agenda.  (It included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g.  the virgin birth.)  The term is now being used by the press to describe aggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who are attempting to legislate religion. Legalism is yet another ill-defined term.  However there is some reason for its use in this context.  In fact the common theological definition is the believe that salvation is through the Law.  I hope no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this view.  However there is a basic difference in approach over what we expect to get out of the Bible.  The conservative approach expects to find specific behavioral rules.  Generally the posters advocating this approach talk about the relevant passages from Paul's letter as God's Law.  The liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the culture and other things.  It's easy to see why a liberal would regard the conservative approach as legalism.  It's hard to know quite what other term to use.  The issue in this case is not inerrancy, because no one is saying that Paul made a factual error.  Rather, the question is whether his statements are to be taken as Law.  Calling the positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology.  I haven't seen any good alternative. --clh]

Interesting point.  The Bible doesn't say "hate the sin". It tells to avoid sin, resist sin, even, when necessary, denounce sin. But not hate. --  :-  Michael A.

The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar. I have yet to see an adequate explanation of St. Jerome's translation of Genesis 3:15.  His Latin clearly uses the feminine, but I don't know why, since the Hebrew is clearly masculine.  If anyone knows of a scholarly treatment of this puzzle, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Yeah, right. > One of the reasons I sold my '92 Civic VX was the chattery-grabby clutch although I din't notice it being any worse in humid weather, perhaps because its always humid around here.  I was told by Honda that it has to do with changing from asbestos to non-asbestos linings, which began around 1990. Someone could make some good money selling the old-fashion variety if it's legal to manufacture them these days.  My feeling is that since many other car makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineering problem on the part of Honda.  Three things to look out for on all Honda products - clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.
I watched the game Germany-Czechs in WC today...and i was astonished about the behaviour of the German audience! The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went grazy! They threw coins, extra pucks and other trash into the rink...is that stupid or what?? I guess the Canadian referee (one of the Isostar-bros ;) gave the German team a penalty for that, but it didn't help much. I guess the Germans just are proud over their Nazi-Kill-'em-All-Everyone- But-Us-Germans-Sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport (remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer) It really pisses me off! I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks, but  most of them seem to do... 	Jokke Kylmaoja

: Arrogance is arrogance.  It is not the result of religion, it is the result : of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show : others of one's rightness.  I assume that God decided to be judge for our : sake as much as his own, if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the  : judge, we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged  : ourselves.   I'm not sure I agree with this 100%.  I agree that arrogance is not the result of religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's superior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person's beliefs. I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall into the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area I hope you will forgive me. Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that one's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one's religion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied beliefs. It is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong. Were I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow what I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs correct.  That's not arrogance.  That's unavoidable behavior. It is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater than my God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn't I be obligated to change so that their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship that God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble? Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation of one's superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all. Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation in our lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another, "I'm not very smart.  I'm poor.  I'm not good looking.  I'm just a worm in the ground.  I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin, I really cannot help it."  Were this person truely humble, he would take a different approach.  "God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know that you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me, I have been so unthankful.  You've given me power to resist the devil.  I have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you've given me, I have been completely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your love for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to save me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've led.  Lord, please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring glory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I'm so sorry for my wrongs.  Please help me to change." :  : I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because : they don't want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically : don't have anything to do with them. For me, I've often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud "worm in the ground" false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable company. When I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don't feel like being confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness, I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me. At the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about living my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me silently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private, I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help in changing from the error of my ways. The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not. It isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one's ability to serve God.  It's easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creation in our lives instead. : But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right] : and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance, : many of us feel "justified" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if : we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and : over again by the words of others, you'd think we'd either toughen up : or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you : can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn't make that : reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination : that we can change our emotional reactions. :  Sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous statement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant and self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil's aim is to get us into as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci- less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with hot irons.  The way the devil gets under the Father's skin is by hurting those that the Father loves so much. -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 	"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...

While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis    Joseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do. Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there  would probably be a game 6 scheduled.   As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt. One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to give them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis' goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player. Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot. I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph won't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack. ____________________________________________________________________________ |Known throughout the World as The Bosk   |"Christ, you know it ain't easy,| |All Rights Reserved, All Lefts Enhanced  |You know how hard it can be,    | |-----------------------------------------|The way things are goin'        | |"Here they come spinning out of the turn"|They're gonna crucify me"       | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle  : bring them down to use as spares? One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME's, you don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization burn(s).  On-orbit, SSME's are just dead weight, since we don't have an SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means that you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages. Throw-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not- quite-man-ratable.  But I doubt we'd do that; the cost of a launch failure is too high. -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as        the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun
> >before you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable   >profit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to   >it. Whoa!  Watch your terminology.  "Dealer invoice" is *not* "dealer cost". You'll hear lots of ads screaming "two dollars over dealer invoice!!!" Sounds like a real deal, huh?  No.  You know what the "dealer invoice" (also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numbers on it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numbers signify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that the salesman can wave in your face to impress you.  Note that nowhere on the "invoice" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast, low voice saying something like "invoice may not reflect actual dealer cost".  Actually, I *guarantee* it does not reflect actual dealer cost. Also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent. Adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that you want.  Haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of "dealer prep" and "protection package" (i.e. a few squirts of paint and fabric protectant).  While you're at it, ask the salesman to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash.  My  wife and I got a joyride in a twin-turbo Mitsubishi 3000GT when we bought our Mitsubishi mini-van.

What is fornication? (sex outside of marriage, abuse of sex)   Is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage? Isn't it an unatural use of what God has given us? Why is it that homosexuals are using the Grace of God as a license to practice sin?     For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long    beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who    turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only     Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.                                       Jude 4 (NASB) What is defined by God as a legitimate marriage?    For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and    shall cleave to his wife; and the shall become one flesh.                                       Gen 2:24 (NASB)    And He answer and said, "Have you not read, that He who created them    from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS     CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE;    AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?  Consequently they are no longer    two, but one flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no    man separate."                                        Matt 19:4-6 (NASB)    But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let    each woman have her own husband.  Let the husband fulfill his duty    to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.                                       1 Corinthians 7:4,5 (NASB) >  There are plenty of >laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of >which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine >them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and >which ones are "ritual."  Well, I have news for you.

I disagree... Every law that is written in Leviticus should be looked at  as sin.  That is why we have a need for a savior.  I can understand  someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the Levitcal law, but I would hope that they would repent when confronted with it. >>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the >>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse. >Well, la-ti-da.

Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her    menstrual impurity.  And you shall not have intercourse with your    neighbors wife, to be defiled with her.                                     Leviticus 18:19, 20 (NASB) These verses are just as relevant as:    You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an    abomination.                                    Leviticus 18:22 (NASB) Why was God telling the Israelites not to practice such things?    Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these    the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.    For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its     punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.    But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and Judgments, and     shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor    the alien who sojourns among you                                     Leviticus 18:24-26 (NASB) He is the Lord...  Listen to what he has to say...  Nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals.  We do love you, but we don't  agree that what you practice is not sin.  You have not truly repented of your sin.  We hate the sin that is within your lives.  I hate sin that is in my life.  All Christians should hate the sin that is within their own lives.  Confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance.  Yes I agree with John 3:17, but I also know that Jesus said, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"  Matt 3:17.  If you don't agree that homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it?  This means that you remain in bondage to it.  Repent from it and God will set you free.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little & i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs" & and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized & gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least, & that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour? Motorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very corse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back and forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the clutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If  you try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into the next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral between gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the shifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  "speed shifting" (which is what I have always heard "clutchless shifting" called) works pretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the clutch-especially for the lower gears. I think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the engagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of syncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions that are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse and sometimes first).   -- Hewlett Packard             (707) 794-3844 fax,  (707) 538-3693 home 1212 Valley House Drive     IT175, XT350, Seca 750, '62 F-100, PL510 Rohnert Park CA 94928-4999  KC6WUG, LAW, AMA, Dod #7566, I'm the NRA.

It is possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  there is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is induced by the Earth's rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern of the atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equator where it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make Everest- without-oxygen feasible.  Only just feasible, mind you:  the guys who did it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation, and probably incurred some permanent brain damage. --

Woo! So far, we've had the following interpretations of the figure of the `Whore of Babylon' in Rev 17 & 18: a) The United States of America b) MHO dB) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who    corrupt and oppress human society c) Historical Jerusalem d) Historical Rome Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? How about * The prophecy reveals God's judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous state oppressing his chosen people (d) * That God's judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that City's special call, it still rejected God's grace at the decisive time (Rev 11:8? - also isn't Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem?) * That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon (a) and is equally subject to God's judgement * That the Good Book(TM) actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've created. (b) Clever, huh? (<-- Flame here!) No need to argue at all!  I think Mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a deliberate contrast between Rev 17/18 and Rev 21/22 - the mortal Jerusalem chosen by God but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation and the new Jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by God's grace. eg Details like Rev 17:1 `.. who sits on many waters' cf Rev 22 the single stream in the new Jersualem `the river of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.' Rex - didn't understand your post - what's the relevance of Babylonian mystery religions to all this? Please elaborate your ideas about OT & the Book of Rev? Why do you freak at the idea of a primarily `spiritual' interpretation of Rev? I'd mail, but I can't get thru: Something you're not telling us?

SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL       By Laura Pitter     TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August.     But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon.     ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''     Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla, the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there.     ``I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.     Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections.     He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000 patients.     He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said.     His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of the dead were women and children.     The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.     ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no heads.''     Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.     The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''     Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-September he had run out of supplies.     ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding.     ``People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.     ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.     The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.     But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''     Then the hunger set in.     Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said.     ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.     According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.     Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.     ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when I left. And I cried too.'' --  Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham, MA  USA

>Bruce Webster writes: >>Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases >>holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have >>failed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28 >Hi Bruce.  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 18? >Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins is the one who will die.  The son will not >share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the >son.  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and >the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." Actually in D&C 68:25-28 the parents are being held accountable for their own sins.  Specifically they are accountable for their failure to teach their children properly.  If I fail to teach my children that stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if they later indulge in such behavior. This is very similar to the instructions Ezekiel was given in Eze 3:18.  If Ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked,  not only would the wicked die in his sins but the Lord would hold Ezekiel responsible!  Similarly parents are responsible to teach their children right from wrong.  I suspect most Christians (and Jews etc.) would agree that parents have this responsibility.
Subject: $1bil space race ideas/moon base on the cheap. Although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it's an old canard in the space business called "trolling for billionaires"), there is a good chance that a much smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd Congress. This is the Back to the Moon bill, put together by the people who passed the Launch Services Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding. There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million.   Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the Delta Clipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million). We have a clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed to simply wishing for our dreams to come true. Please support the Back to the Moon bill.

Most everyone I knew at the time was quite  impressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine. Motor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with large chains.  Oh yea,FYI:    Pontiac 400 ci bored 0.04 over                            Large Valve heads                         Holley 650 Spread bore                         Crain 'BLAZER' cam (don't remember the specs)                         PosiTrac, Hooker headers, Dual exhaust                         Get this (Conv., leather seats, power windows                                   power top, AC, Cruise etc.)    Oh yea, I also pulled the 'Cocktail shakers' (weights) from the front   and removed the lead pellet from the accelerator pedal.

I would like to know if their is any medical consensus (or consensus within this group) regarding the ethics of the following:   1: Prescription of placebo medications when the patient      did not specifically request any sort of treatment.   2: Selling a placebo medication for a profit.   3: Prescribing homeopathic remedies without advising      a patient of their "controversial nature".   4: Representing homeopathic remedies as "over the counter"      medications.

But before I do, I want to  get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney  stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart  disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to  encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do  most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from  the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to  be ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance. Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have  a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you  or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go. Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help  you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment  program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When  my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin  E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician,  plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet  change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring. But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation  and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as  your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a  regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her  gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even  scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for  the biggest Hospital in Tulsa). One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses  high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is  absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have  drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is  really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and  minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't  be right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a  lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new  Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab  tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet  changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you  handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want, I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really  don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think  that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a  few with an axe to grind.  That's life. Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very  important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor (GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine  and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to  form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast, and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is  seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral  chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest  for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has  come up there several times as a "fat burner".  Chromium is among the least  toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really  do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for  chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about  30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many  believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I  can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in  Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there  also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is  bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when  chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to  Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and  glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is  concerned Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease,  this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little  more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin  responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity  is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular  pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with  glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll.  Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt  people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing,  just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless  they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often  found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the  RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would  prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to  check out this possible chromium link to glucoma. You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC  chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a  RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail  analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny  business going on in these unregulated labs right now. Here's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider  chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is  available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they  also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not  routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change  and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical  response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium  supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of  CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day. What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight (they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then  exercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most  Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have  a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.   When he or she says, "what in the world are you talking about", just say,  please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook  and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose  tolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you  very much. Marty B.

L.  acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily  responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of  the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L.  bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are  much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told  me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several  different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't  told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative  anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a  chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria  around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal  region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida  blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from  the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do  believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower  colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the  competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked. Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get  rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A  supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the  good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the  pH to basically starve the candida out.

>Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon >cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.   No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  I'm rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature in the accepted academic/scientific journals.  So, the righteous among them will no doubt jump on that. Also, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption that it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the GI tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for maybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too. Then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even though he, like Linus Pauling, is lucid and robust well into his nineties--but nevermind about that.  He shouldn't charge for his equipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the FDA.  Of course, with FDA approval an MD or pharmaceutical company can charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as thalidomide.  But nevermind about that either.

Any "stigma" associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests solely upon the parents--they've committed a sexual transgression for which they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations on him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the parents' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS theology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the subsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of Mormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have failed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church). Also note that there is no "big genealogical book in Salt Lake City". The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains containing (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening, baptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I may be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2 billion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is building up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there some kind of "worthiness screening" as to whether someone can be entered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the parents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database. ..bruce.. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bruce F.

That's why they're used.   Actually, I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a "sugar pill". I don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always labeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the name. It's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something, just not for what you have.  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most common such placebo.  >	3. >Getting what you pay for.  (Deceptive "bait and switch" to an extreme...).

This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer  here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human  nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do  when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the  mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and  their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that  most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by  diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting  your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is  justified. From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition: > 	In a psychological anthropology course I am taking, we got  > sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared > by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, sugar > intake, and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms. > 	Is there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey? >  > Many thanks, >  > Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got  side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most  physicians don't recognize it as a specific "disease" entity.  Here is  everything that you would ever want to know about PMS. Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups: 	PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression) 	anxiety			depression 	irritability		forgetfulness 	insomnia		confusion 	depression		lethargy 	PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration) 	craving for sweets	weight gain 	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness 	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities 	 2. palpitations 	 3. fatigue or fainting   PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low  progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle. PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple  carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is  increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose  challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are  a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia  is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of  hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia. 	A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium  supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of  the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources  of alpha linoleic acid. PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal  phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead  toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal  phase). "Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human  endometrial cystol" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972). PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated  serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E  for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form: 	A. "Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for  	    a nutritional approach". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine.  	    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986. 	B. "Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension  	    syndromes", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983). 	C. "Premenstrual tension", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980) Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can  find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one  that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work,  supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really  has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida  blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental  controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to  see done). Here are a few of these studies: 	CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, "Effect of a low-fat,  	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" Lancet  	2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy  	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive  	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories  	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary  	advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant  	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in  	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as  	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling,  	tenderness and nodularity. 	VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, "The use of Vitamin A in  	premenstrual tension" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).   	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU  	vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored  	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of  	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the  	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool  	size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this  	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose  	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10%  	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.   	10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS  	symptoms. 	Experimental Controlled Study, "Premenstrual tension treated with  	vitamin A" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts  	received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their  	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.   	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in  	PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of  	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year  	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms  	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the  	vitamin A supplementation was stopped. Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.   These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal  store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins  given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best  single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid  (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full  of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent  the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying  to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin  A toxicity. 	VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, "Pyridoxine 	(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover  	trial"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49  	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.   	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another  	3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of  	PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS  	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, "The efects of vitamin B6  	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" Obstet. Gynecol  	70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received  	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence  	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related  	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as  	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)   	Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6  	supplementation. Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control  pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.   Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per  day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R.  Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in  Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be  considered the "first-line" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the  patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin  B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each  day.  	VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Efficacy of alpha- 	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" J. Reprod.  	Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3  	cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a  	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast  	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant  	reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38%  	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo  	group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant 	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, "The effect of alpha-tocopherol on  	premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study" J. Am. Coll. Nutr.  	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly  	received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After  	2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly  	improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly  	improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H 	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve  	PMT-H symptoms). 	 	MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Magnesium prophylaxis  	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" Headache  	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg  	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a  	placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and  	continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index  	was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment  	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual  	Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in   	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower  	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer  	from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised  	into the normal range. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Oral Magnesium successfully  	relieves premenstrual mood changes" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991).  	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid  	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the  	onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received  	magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster  	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the  	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were  	switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on  	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by  	magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium  	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes  	that occur during PMS. There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the  medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder  that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But  since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med.  to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are  also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on  multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the  best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out  that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize  nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri,  pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor  being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS  is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional  disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses. Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral  supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS. 	Experimental Study, "Effect of a nutritional programme on  	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", Complement. Med.  	Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and  	supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E,  	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to  	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate  	diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an  	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that  	they no longer suffered from PMS.  	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Role of Nutrition in managing  	premenstrual tension syndromes", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).   	A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite  	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet  	change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the  	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased  	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel  	phase of their cycle. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Clinical and biochemical effects  	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", J.  	Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12  	tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a  	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another  	group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this  	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on  	PMS symptoms was observed.

>The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year.  I had the Rangers >on MSG, and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time.  Yes, >I'd rather have SC cover it, just for the amount of coverage. > So this year you had a game on SCNY, a game on SCA, a game on ESPN, and if the Rangers hadn't crashed and burned, you would have had a game on MSG.  What are you complaining about? I seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage.  I even remember Orioles' games being shown in the DC area instead of hockey.  And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other games because its feature game was over?  Sound familiar? This year I'm getting twice the coverage.  I can see all the Caps games *plus* the games ESPN shows.  I think it's great that hockey is back on ESPN.  IMHO, they're doing a great job especially considering the baseball contract they have to work around. -- Peter Kester
I knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still too much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any playoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16, they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but it is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate. I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time without much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs. She told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf was shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She then couldn't give me a coherent answer. Also, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with  thier sports programming. I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain bitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation. The lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. Sometimes, the reason is low ratings. Then another time, she says contractual obligations.

Roy outplayed  >Hextall for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall  >the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities. Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there  are any legitimate excuses.  >Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces  >[description of lucky bounces.....] >Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...  I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result  in a goal.  > ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against >an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with >a powerplay that was totally unnecessary. In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as 'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second  goal. >This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, >as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau >were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave >up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss. What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the  game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy* goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal. >>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot. >And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please.  WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times. >Roy is paid big money because >that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5 For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league.  In fact, I agree that he is. >The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory >comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans.                              I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective (and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.  --

------------- cut here ----------------- call for employers to keep  information about the HIV status of health-care  workers  confidential.  But doctors who know of an HIV-positive colleague  who  has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate  professional regulatory body.  The guidelines  also emphasize the significance  of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an  infected health-care  worker.  A model letter to patients who have come into  contact  with such an individual is provided, along with suggestions for   health officials on how to deal with the media.  In addition, a  U.K. advisory  panel on HIV infection in health-care workers has  been formed to provide  specific occupational recommendations to  those treating such patients.  ==================================================================     "Properties of an HIV 'Vaccine'" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 504    (Volvovitz, Franklin and Smith, Gale)       The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160  envelope  glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantages  rather than disadvantages, write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of  MicroGeneSys in Meriden,  Conn.  Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus  expression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this   recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus  does in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in  patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune  responses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and  CD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never  intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibody  responses against native HIV-1 proteins,  including the types described by  Moore et al., exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 42 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 progression of HIV disease.  In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120- antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific  activation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which   may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4  binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added  safety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts,  stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune  function.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was  chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first  phase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith.  ==================================================================     341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)       There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive  women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The  anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of  leukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic   activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to  barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to  twelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.   Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory  illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive  mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than  bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower  progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer  protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of  milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA  antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against  core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a  human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and  malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is  still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.   Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early  milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast  milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and   may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok.  ==================================================================     "Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients" Journal  of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1802   (Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.)       If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV  transmission  from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M. Dickinson  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 43 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 et al. of the University of Miami  School of Medicine in Miami, Fla.  The  researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and  attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients  with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis  was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the  dentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the  medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug  abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.   There were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124   were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients  identified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either  homosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the  remaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was  reported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence  of risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single   evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence  analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients  were not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV  transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting  in which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et  al.         ================================================================                                    April 22, 1993         ================================================================    "AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says" Washington  Post (04/22/93), P. A13       Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the  resurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published in  today's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usually  develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria  again.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight  off a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes  Medical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in  order to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to  use TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB  bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County  Hospital  in New York.  ================================================================     341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)       There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive  women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's   hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to  AIDS, "a hindrance to public health initiatives."   However, their hypothesis  that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.   The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy,  no prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this  hypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4   depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies  against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals  from Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug- AIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug- free AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT   use altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to  produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years  HIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same  AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS.   Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs  for 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg.  ================================================================    "Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection"  Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.)       Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases  in some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected  individuals through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions,  write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.   The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with  hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,   profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the  observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had  circulating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the  end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,  contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the   aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens,  homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.   These autoantibodies, which also  recognize "native" class II molecules and  may contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells "in vivo", were at low tires  (50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such   autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and  HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss  in some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA  antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell  counts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very   rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with  these HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude.         ================================================================                                    April 23, 1993         ================================================================     "TB Makes a Comeback" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6    (Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.)       Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United  States, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants,  minorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the  University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung  Association,  said, "Right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's   everyone's problem."  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected  with TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their  immune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.  Gene  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 Tammes, a Centers for  Disease Control expert, said that is why the CDC has  issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB  patients.  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because  those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with  treatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public  health services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number of  cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George   Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to  Diferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of  diagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City  residents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their   medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more  expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to  treat.  ================================================================      "Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern  83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.)       The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in  southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write  Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.   The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal  Palm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual  transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users,  or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route  of HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records  from social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually  transmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor  was found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a   standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were  reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission  categories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the  percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties  between January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to  heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men  and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of   heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after  adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the  national average, the researchers  conclude.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason they are considered "cleaner" is because they are better at the emissions we actually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissions which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or limits have been defined.   Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulates are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives. And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is awful and it can even burn the eyes.   Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.  Mark
   This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,    anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far    as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.    That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution    to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well    known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)    are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution... Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to make tight-binaries of neutron stars. Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but that uses pretty far-out physics. My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't rule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets aren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the "Tunguska Meteorite" was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet collisions matches the GRB rate well. The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them out.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got the wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort- cloud GRB's at all. Executive summary: we don't know enough to rule out out the Oort cloud.

  The goalie to whom you refer is Clint Malarchuk.  He was at that time playing with the Sabres.  His team immediately prior to that was the Washington Capitals.  While he did recover and continue to play, I do not know his present whereabouts.
If I were Pat Burns I'd throw in the towel. The wings dominated every aspect of the game.  Trying to mix up the lines is a dead end.  Murray has too many combinations to counter with. My prediction is wings in 5. Mark Let's Go Wings!!!

			    Conviction of Sin 		A meta-exegetical or methodological essay >I can't post it all at once, so it will come piece meal and not daily. I look forward to reading it.  When I got to the library last week, it was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared over the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un- fortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn't get a look at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reserve my own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly work, and I can hope that REXLEX's posting may give some meat to chew on. However, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues -- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter. If the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better; if not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard. >                 James B. DeYoung writes, _in abstractu_: >this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it >from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual >orientation and behavior 	[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has 	already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that 	the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and 	NOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the 	article as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.] The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and b) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The questions I wish to raise are 	1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis? and	2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the 	     discussion) that it is correct? Note that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a), which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the literature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know, Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless you have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound methodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi- ate text to "fix" the coinage's meaning for his audience. As yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat plausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way of construing this problem passage.)  I'm going to set aside for the moment the question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the more tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle, two kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is, we can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to derivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning. The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no internal evidence for Paul's meaning.  He uses the word totally without an explanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of negatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning. We are left, as the only "internal" clue, with the etymology or formation of the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before him) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with other men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex ("lie" in Leviticus, "bed" in Greek).  One problem is that "bedders" (_-koitai_) is not, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one serious test which de Young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected: 	o  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much 	   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies 	   "men who have sex with X"  [obviously, the "best case" is to 	   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.] such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way. It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under- standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition of the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesis correct -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or not original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible of comprehension by his readers. My "test" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT in his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his readers to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage) or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that they can guess his meaning without too much floundering. External evidence, that is, texts other than Paul's own and lexicographic or social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into the picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul, which *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by a contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu- ality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one has grounds for 	o  denying that Paul coined the word and	o  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning Do you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his readers to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and its intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young's guess) understand him to be referring to the Levitical "universal" prohibition of male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized at least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians -- how else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled back from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah law to his gentile converts!) Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined the word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or Ionic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be assimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What is Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation? And if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in his list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for his readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no other.) I cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by this word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least, had a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and explained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of evidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy. So -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word. And it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem. I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about the word: 	a)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe 	    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities 	b)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual 	    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their 	    part with the Leviticus passage) 	c)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an 	    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not 	    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application 	    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER 	    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me 	    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing.] Of these, I'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but I still have reservations about that, too. If the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence of depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul's coining it.  If it does appear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior use (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should normally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they can be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In either of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul's relation to the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be from the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul's relations are hardly straight- forward! There is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid us in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as good as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things). But it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don't know about you, but I for one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means be convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he says elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this same character (Romans 14:22-23) 	"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and 	consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going 	against his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt 	is condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done 	in bad faith is a sin." For my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of _arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by the nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty of constraining Paul's own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and all the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices -- and sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you to God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul's words HAVE led some people), then Paul's intense communicative effort to contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences. I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I read him "in the large", if I can see him lay out his position in detail and hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.) In my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first of my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm that Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as the Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo- thesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and for later Christians.  Given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow night's meditation :-) --  Michael L. Siemon		I say "You are gods, sons of the     - or -			you shall die like men, and fall

I'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I can here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).  I'm hoping I can get a reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas. I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly, THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging? As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, I can't help but feel for the people in Minnesota, unless they truly didn't support the team.   Opinions, please.

I'm not sure were this thread has been before i popped in, but I've never thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or competence. I just can't imagin any valid reason for having a gun that can't wait a few days. I can think of plenty of bad reasons for not wanting a waiting period: I want to buy a gun and kill so-and-so right now, I've crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and I can't afford to spend the night here, etc. I'm not a big fan of guns, but I feel that it is important to guard American's rights to own them. On the other hand, we license and regulate many things without seriously impeding anyones constitutional rights. Carl

After all, he did get a suspension for it... Hey, that's fine!  If a player does something stupid, he should be penalized including Ulf.  Or Mario (you're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter.

More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals    showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I   know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a   and some local governments. The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can   tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make   AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most   drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but    this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called   extra profits.

Subject: "The Universe of MOTION" (book review)                                 (Book Review):                                 "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North            Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed,            hardcover.                            "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to            most ALL astrophysical mysteries.                            This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged            edition of "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE", 1959.             Volume I is "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979), and Volume II is            "THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988).                            Most books and journal articles on the subject of            astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial            differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by            contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except            for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.             Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical            agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual            validity.                            Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor            of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State            University.  He developed the Theory described in his books            while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the            properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements            they contain.                            "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" describes the astrophysical            portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE,            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of            "grand unified field theory" that orthodox physicists and            astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two            postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of            space and time:                            (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME.                            (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                            From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a            COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the            concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with            translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-           vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including            EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959            book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES,            several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They            are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And            when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation            ready for those also.                            As a result of his theory, which he called "THE            RECIPROCAL SYSTEM", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists,            including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter,            quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure),            "nuclear" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass            increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in            stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be            nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very            critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles,            solutions in principle, "no other way" declarations, etc.,            used to maintain them.                            "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" is divided into 31 chapters.             It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from            the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters,            which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that            accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in            from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy            formation from the MYTHICAL "big bang" is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and            solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of            SINGLE stars.                            Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according            to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have            been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies            and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT            (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME).                            Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against            observations that contradict their theories would find            Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an            OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY            BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the            plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray            telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from            ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any            visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional            coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER            HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the "cosmic            sector".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a            RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed            of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE            dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the            bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly            at random.                            Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from            books, journal articles, and leading physicists and            astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted            with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the            end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book            says, "Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if            we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars            form.... Unfortunately we cannot."  Larson's book contains            LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are            WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists,            astronomers, and astrophysicists.

The third was to stay inside. Last time I checked, "amassing an arsenal" and practicing any kind of religion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights.  Guess it's OK with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing a bunch of religious nutcakes, eh? Of all the idiots I run into in daily life, Dan, your type scare me the most.  You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief just as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who doesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and therefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the government says is wrong to be wrong. David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists, methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT even though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe the same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment. You see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others fit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned  from it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice just isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go my own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else, either individually or collectively as the great socialist "we" has ANY  RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong. You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound in order to "save themselves".  Think (if you're capable) for a moment about some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if suddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are beneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear enough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically designed to force you to make that "forsake or die" decision? The "forsake or die" option is exactly what the government forced on the Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that first shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51 when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The people who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those people go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.  People like you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with "well they could have come out" get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your face were there not a network between us.

Though I don't >mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile, >it does seem to be one motivation for giving up >faith.  Thus, some atheism might result from  >broken-ness. I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower of Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply _couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the troubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with God. The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through most of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do mean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time) would fail. The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my  life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor have I ever been, "on fire for Chirst," and I don't think I ever want to be. Nevertheless, I am not "lukewarm" about my faith, so I don't really fit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right, but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because all the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own. Complete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called "people of God" are behaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back. IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively- hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and "shut-up-and-do-what- you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and- you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet" courtesy of some of Christ's more overzealous followers.   A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a very good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had for one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world, Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help them.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the emporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of  their own moral view. There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time to go into them right now. Tom Ault

Joe Moore writes:  > Paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side. Some think  > it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows? Whatever the  > thorn was, apparently it was not compatible with Christianity,  > yet does that make his epistles any less? Paul mentions his "thorn" (SKOLOPS, actually a sharp stake) in 2 Corinthians 12:7-9  + And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of  + revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of  + Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three  + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me;  + but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my  + power is made perfectr in weakness." He does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral problem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He ordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and his signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says, "See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand," or else, "See what a long letter I have written with my own hand." If the former translation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the small script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters larger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the Galatians (4:13-15),  + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached  + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial  + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an  + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you  + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. Perhaps this last line means simply, "You would have done anything for me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes)." But in that case, we would expect some wording like, "If I had needed them." "If it were possible" sounds as though the bodily ailment was connected with his eyes. William Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific suggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he had been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had a malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to leave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might well have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.  Yours,  James Kiefer

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort.  You can spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches. What's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on investment.  If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and the prize is just the icing on the cake. I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current US launchers.  (There would surely be a buy-American clause in the rules for such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.) You're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch system rather than pissing it away on existing ones.  Being there first is of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it. >... could I get a couple of CanadARMs tuned for the lunar environment?

If we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from speaking in church. Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could err. I find it interesting that CHRIST never discussed the issue of homosexuality, certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious transgression CHRIST would have condemned it.  I find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying to stamp out something that CHRIST didn't consider worth a single word of condemnation. CHRIST repeatedly warns us against judgement.  Don't we risk "judgement in equal measure" when we condemn people who  GOD himself did not judge when he walked on the earth? --     |         The love of CHRIST is contagious!         --+--                                              |                                                 [I should not that many of our readers do in fact advocate forbiding women from speaking in church.

=Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY =time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products. Which points up the "studies" made by amateurs:  Did you ALSO check EVERY TIME YOU DID *NOT* get sick?  "No," you say?  Why not check every thing you eat when you don't get sick and find out how much MSG you're actually consuming? => All that's needed now is that final step, a double-blind study done => on humans.  There isn't even an ethical question about "possible => harm", as this is a widely used and approved food additive. = =But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG - =some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.

If you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didn't want to participate because it involved MSG, you'd've already made yourself ineligible (since MSG IS detectable by taste).

Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.  Colossians 3:16 A reminder: These verses are from the New International Version. As with any translation, faithfulness to the original Hebrew and Greek may vary from time to time. If a verse sounds a little off occasionally, compare it with another translation or with the original texts, if you are able to do so. God Bless You, Chuck Petch
I've had cold sores in the past.  But they have always been in the  corner of my mouth.  Recently,  I've had what appears to be a cold sore, but on my lower lip in the middle (above the chin). Can cold sores appear anywhere around the mouth (or body)? Is there a medical term for cold sore? --   From the beautiful and historic New York State Mid-Hudson Valley.

Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle, of the Blues.

He just wasn't diagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to have some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just been put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted as long as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between reality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they've checked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands over and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oven ten times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie about something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his own life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes, but still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt it slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).  In any event, he is alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with the Gulls (IHL).   > >Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.

Does anyone know how posionous centipedes and millipedes are? If someone was bitten, how soon would medical treatment be needed, and what would be liable to happen to the person?

People with early life hernias are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias. The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.   However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is  high enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probably no higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it would be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy.

How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment.  Ran forward, it would suck energy from the Earth's magnetic field, while trivially slowing the Shuttle.  It could also have run backward -- if they ran  electricity through the tether the other way, it would have trivially propelled the Shuttle faster. But an even better example comes to mind.  There's this electronics guy, someone like Craig Anderton or Don Lancaster.  Ten years ago he wrote about an invention of his.  He could take a light-detector, run current through it at about a hundred times its rating, and it would glow.  He got legal rights to this design of a combination "fiber optic emitter/receiver".  This turned out to be the basic unit of ATT's  (I think) plan to bring Brazil's communications system into the 21st century.

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung  disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also  binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when  EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that  were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove  calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C  and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra  vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium  from the plaques). The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably  can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns  with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium. 	1. "Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review" 	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with  	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels.  	2. "The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular  	    disease" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the  	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be  	    overemphasized.  This is a review article. 	3. "Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis  	   in cholesterol-fed rabbits" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).   	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of  	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol  	   added to their normal food. Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for  the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients. Marty B.
After seeing William Sessions on television, explaining the great lengths to which the FBI went to determine the suicidal tendancies of David Koresh,  I got the very unpleasent feeling that Koresh had manipulated the FBI's  perceptions much the way he manipulated his own followers.

There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I saw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact with air.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to the tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere, and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially semi-rural areas. > 	Further, the BD members have as much reason to lie as the  > 	Gov't.

Come on Boston, where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what, choke? I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than Buffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting.  Not that Buffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight, but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0 pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils.  You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?). Ah, well, maybe the Devils will pull it out, or maybe the Pens will lose in the second round, but if not, I hope the Bruins are there to meet them.
It's basement cleaning time.  This stuff has got to go. I have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes, around 20 tapes/box.  They are free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up.  They've seen very little use.  If anyone wants these bad enough to ship, they're yours for the cost of shipping, the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee. I have a lot of serial cables.  I have all kinds, ribbon, shielded, long, short M-M, M-F whatever you want.  Most appear to work well with PC serial ports, but I will not gaurantee that.  Tell me what you want and I'll do the best I can to match.  1.50 ea or 10/$10.  Shipping included.  No CODs under $20.  (You want to pay a $5 COD charge for a $1.50 cable?  Go buy the cable at your local computer store instead, it'll be cheaper.)  I believe these cables were removed from service at a computer center.  They appear to be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well. I also have a 15 KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair, probably a logic board.  It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high.  I think they used to run a Prime system off of it.  Best offer over $75, but you  need to come pick it up.  Use this to run your house from your solar panels. I will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff. --  Paul Amaranth  Manager User Services - office: (313) 370 4541 (also voicemail) (uucp)         ...!uunet!umich!vela!amaranth  |      empty
Getting wierd again? Okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large and to expensive.. Okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. Kind of liek the old MIRV principle of old Cold War Days.  Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for different missions,namely different planets. Each probe would be tied in with the mother ship (or earth as the case may be).. This is good when and if we go for Mars (the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the probes. Also the mother ship would be powered (if not the Mars Mission) by a normal propulsion, but also a solar sail (main reason for solar sail race is to see what can be done and autmoated?) the sail would get the probes to were they needed.. I know the asteroid/meteor clouds (and such) might get in the way of a  Sail?? Main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send multiple probes/mission/satellites/exploreres to different places and cut costs.. The probes could do fly bys or ?? we shall see... ==

an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth. it appears in both the 0430-1500UT ir and visual images of the earth. the GIF images can be down loaded from vmd.cso.uiuc.edu and are named CI043015.GIF and CV043015.GIF for the IR and visual images respectively. pretty cool pictures;  in the ir it's saturated but in the visual image details on the moon are viewable. the moon is not in the 1400UT images.

Two notes of interest from Texas: The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering judgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had his hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black. The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for the ATF.  I have heard them referred to as "those fucking cowboys".  The DPS was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as "traffic cops".  ATF now has two strikes against them. Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the flashed "an automatic weapon" at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.  And you wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the ATF. -- Dillon Pyron                      | The opinions expressed are those of the TI/DSEG Lewisville VAX Support    | sender unless otherwise stated.

>This paragraph brought to mind a question.  How do you (Mormons) reconcile >the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection >people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)? Here is the short answer: because only certain marriages are recorded in Heaven. Now for the long answer: In Doctrine and Covenants section 132, the  chapter discussing eternal marriage (and, yes, plural marriage), the distinction between sealings under the priesthood and other  marriages is revealed.   When "the children of this world marry, or are given in marriage" when they receive "the  resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage" (Luke 20:34-35). Jesus was simply teaching that marriages "until death do you part" are not in force after death. However, the Doctrine and Covenants continues  describing eternal marriage. D&C 132:19    And again, verily I say unto you, if a  man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed this power and the keys  of this priesthood; ... [ shortened for brevity AI] and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels,  and the gods, which are set there, to their  exhaltation and glory in all things, as hath been  sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a  fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever. The Lord told Peter "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matt 16:19). Do you doubt that Peter was given the power to  perform sealings? Peter thought so because he taught that husbands and wives were "heirs *together* of the grace of life" (1 Peter 3:7). "In order to obtain the highest" (degree of celestial glory), a man must enter into this order of the priesthood" (D&C 131:2). When a man and wife are sealed they truly become  "one flesh" because their eternal "increase"  (destinies) are enjoined completely. Our Father has an eternal companion (and maybe more because of the plural marriage conditions of the law) who participated in our creation and is equally concerned with our progress here. There is no scriptural basis for this doctrine. If fact, the only mention of our Mother is in one verse of a hymn written early in the history of the Church:     O My Father     I had learned to call thee Father,     Through thy Spirit from on high,     But, until the key of knowledge     Was restored, I knew not why.     In the heav'ns are parents single?     No, the thought makes reason stare!     Truth is reason; truth eternal     Tells me I've a mother there. Why don't we hear more about our Mother? 1.  Because our Father presides under Priesthood authority (which is not a calling for Her); 2.  Because we don't all (necessarily) have the same Mother it would be confusing for worship; 3.  Because our Father wishes to withhold Her name and titles because of how some people degrade sacred things. A IDLER

David Hammerslag asked: 	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage 	with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will 	neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)? Several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed, but most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less one of the following three positions: (1) Jesus was talking to a group of people (Sadducees) who were trying     to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa-     tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they     didn't believe in).  These people -- and those associated with them     ("Now there were with us seven brethren", Matt. 22:25) -- would not     be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,     the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-     ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not     have this blessing. (2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of     =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter     activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in     the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of     before then. (3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is     missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note     that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in     general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with     modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-     ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question     was not significantly revised in the "Joseph Smith Translation" or     "Inspired Version" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work     was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-     stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV. --  35 King St. N. // Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2J 2W9 // +1 (519) 884-2251

SOunds like a personal choice to me. Religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs, is probably at the core of what happened in Waco. We in the west tend to disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions. I suspect that this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs. BUt we'll probably never know... Karl

The reasoning was that congregations are free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions choose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they were not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not be forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part of the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th Annivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very issue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years). A couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens ordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  In theory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or refused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be disciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is unlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation was a mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation worked very well.   We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years assembly.  At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of same-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so).  Our Panel on Doctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year - the matter will be considered and debated then. Hope this is interesting Alison
Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith                          THE LIES OF TEXAS Okay, what have we learned? For reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known  -- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative  committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard of the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and  personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the  First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to  the Constitution.  The man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw  agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own  losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his  electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside  world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in  pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency  finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit  eager to gain credit for "straightening out the mess" -- and, more  importantly, to script his side of the subsequent "negotiations"  any way they please.  The impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time  four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a  single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history.  Armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers  using scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious  records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive  those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority  will mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean  Communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment).  Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising  of the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house  and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and  is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives,  including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out.  Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the  President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme:  blame the victim.  He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a  secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being  "examined" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children  -- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination.  He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in  3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that  Jim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to  embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was  severed at the start of the whole travesty.  A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe  that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow  responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever  know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound  more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll?  Very well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never  forget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and  rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission,  it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which  may explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage  and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did)  about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a  mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights.  More importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower  of Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance  as Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the  system, then at least within yourself.  On March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of  the Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw  agency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised  in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both  agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped  to write that plank.  True, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in  1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone  in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their  behinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what  happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977,  Waco never would have happened.  Think about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough  of political parties more interested in collecting and holding  power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human  life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe  the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less  tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote. Think about it. L. Neil Smith and (forthcoming) PALLAS Libertarian Second Amendment Caucus NRA Life Member My opinions are, of course, my own.

One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that could be causing "difficulty with his behavior".  Standard practice would be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.  One would want to rule out the possibility that the "bad behavior" is not psychiatric illness at all. --  :-  Michael A.

[referring to Mary] >She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, >but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was >possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God. I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin. Was Mary fully human?  If it is possible for God to miraculously make  a person free of original sin, and free of committing sin their whole life, then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus?  Why can't God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us sinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that? I don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption, or the perpetual virginity (both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which I will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in Christ), and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, but this concept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the rest of Christian doctrine as I understand it. == Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living,                                               | God will find his people busy Opinion, what opinions?

>I'm getting a car in the near future.  I've narrow it down to 300ZX and SC300. >Which might be a better choice? Having driven both, and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now, all I can say is "it depends".  They're both great cars.  In fact, my wife and I are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year. The 300ZX handles like a dream, while the SC300 rides like a dream. Fit and finish on both are excellent, but the Lexus gets the nod in customer satisfaction.  They're both very attractive, and hideously expensive.  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX.  The 300ZX isn't available with traction control, which makes it a handful on slippery surfaces. --  Jim Battan - Sequent Computer Systems, Beaverton, OR +1 503 578 5129

Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be possible.  The CGRO, is, what, 10 meters long?  You'd need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this. What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors (also as a function of photon energy).  Each of the detectors does not have isotropic response.  To do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector, and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto the spacecraft.  I believe they have now reduced the error to about 2 degrees. 	Paul F. Dietz

Of course, I mean that in the nicest way.  :-)   And just how much bragging did YOU do, "wobbie," on r.s.b.c after  UMASS!!! beat your Quakers? BTW.  Congratulations should go to the Sabres.  They are playing more diciplined, and with more will to win.  They deserve it.
  It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of nightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.      For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three games of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this time.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.    On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice advantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It wasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.    John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting goaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday. Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on the powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box. LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was Khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and Hannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob Sweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of penalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get his first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime. Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet revenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime. Both teams finished with 34 shots.           Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.         Referee--Rob Shick. clutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic again.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea to Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was only five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no one took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview, noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was too loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't skate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each were out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than that, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he must not understand playoffs.

: That more or less says it.  I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw : Ulf cross-check Valeri in the face.  I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to : go off on this at all in coach's corner. And that was the ONLY infraction of this type in the game.  Come on! Wake up! Geez He's not the only player who does this sort of thing. I think we were kind of lucky.

Hello all, I know that after market sunroofs may have left a bad taste in some of   your mouths, but I am really interested in finding a "good" brand if one   exists.  Please let me know if you have heard of any makers with a good reputation (few failures, no leaks, that sort of thing) and whether or not you have had first hand experience with that manufacturer.  Who is generally regarded in the industry as the "best" (price no object) maker   of power sunroofs??  --Steve ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Stratus Computer 		|   Marlboro MA 			|

The per capita acts of violence are probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a thousand years ago! There is nothing new about violence. rf

I have recently purchased (within the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.   Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering.   So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the new Super Ka wideband.   Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is now the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my "new" detector? Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be  worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the  market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar  bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business. > >                                  \|/ >                                ####### >                              / ~     ~ \ >                              |[0]---[0] | >   ===============================| |=================================== >  _|___                           |_|        		    	    ___|_ > (_____) Allen Tobias           Technical    email:                (_____) > (_____) 3000 Waterview Parkway                                    (_____) > (___)   Richardson, TX 75083                                        (___) >   ===================================================================== >   "No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care!" > --

I know that alot of how people think and act in a long distance space project would be much like old tiem explorers, sailors, hunters and such who spent alot of time alone, isolated, and alone or in minimal surroundings and sopcial contacts.. Such as the old arctic and antarctic expeditions and such.. I vote for a later on sci.space.medicine or similar newsgroup fro the discussion of long term missions into space and there affects on humans and such.. ==
People who criticize "big Government" and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term.   (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.) As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations, doesn't it?) But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture, despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little sense to try to save money. Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be.   It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects. GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools.   -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      "A scientist can discover a new star, but he cannot make one.

I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of engineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year old BMW is still as sweet as it was new. But I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow. I have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I still try to avoid driving in the snow.

We're about to have our first baby, and have a few questions that we dont seem to be able to get answered to our satisfaction.  Reguarding having a baby boy circumsized, what are the medical pros and cons?  All we've heard is 'its up to the parents'. How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water?  We've heard  stories of infection, etc.  How about after the water has broken? Old MacDonald had an agricultural real estate tax abatement.
In some sense, I think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful, and the folks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are both right. That is, I think that space advertising is an interesting idea, and if someone wants to try it out, more power to them. However, a company may discover that the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising, and a company who  gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would gain might decide to bow out of the project. I got incensed when I read that Carl Sagan called this idea an "abomination."  I don't think that word means what he thinks it does. Children starving in the richest country in the world is an abomination; an ad agency is at worst just in poor taste. Tom Courtney

I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to BATSE press releases. The idea behind the statement is as follows:       "if you smack two neutron       stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,       a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a       cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy        is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes       thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.       The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must       be wrong." As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding  medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees, Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the  so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers, but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario. On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must  ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths, or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work, and therefore it *must* be so-and-so.

I disagree with what to tout, although I agree that the space program is inherently a good thing.  Most people today only care about "what will it cost me?" and "what's in it for me?" and could care less about whether something is simply worthwhile in and of itself.  Our society has become increasingly geared toward the short-term (which you could read as NOW!).  They couldn't care less about next week, much less next century.  They want something to show for the expenditure and they want it *now*. I think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that are spinoffs of the space program.  That is the only way you can *prove* its worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too.

I saw this a few years ago on "Tomorrow's World" (low-brow BBC technology news program).  The patient is lowered into a bath of de-ionized water and carefully positioned.  High intensity pressure waves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't get electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct).  These waves are focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to break up.  This is completely painless.

I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the greater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rate and PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate is associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its size. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when exercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners.  So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart patients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficial aspects to athlete's heart? Is it all good?

>I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church >neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment, as >confirmed in the recent catechism, though there are many RCs >who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was >not explicitly condemned. I quote from the journal, "30 Days In the Church and In the World," 1992, No. 8/9, p. 29.  Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism: 	In procuring the common good of society the need could arise 	that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot 	cause harm.  By virtue of this, the right and obligation of  	public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties, 	including the death penalty, is acknowledged.  For similar 	reasons, legimate authorities have the right to impede 	aggressors in society with the use of arms.  The Church's  	traditional teaching has always been expressed and will  	continue to be expressed in the  	consideration of the real conditions of common good and the 	effective means for preserving public order and personal 	safety.  To the degree that means other than the death 	penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the 	peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred 	because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the 	final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.   As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church's teaching on capital punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.   >I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken >as support for capital punishment. I take it that as a Roman >Catholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsider >it wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by >"authority". I seek to conform my will to the will of God as expounded by His instrument of the visible Church here on earth whenever the question of faith or morals arises.   --  Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock  Catechist

Of course, they were baptised, but only after "God showed that He accepted them by giving them the Holy Spirit". This means they were already acceptable to God before their baptism, and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven. In case that seems far-fetched - an ancestor of mine was a missionary who worked among the Hereros in Namibia. Some of the tribesmen were jealous of Christianity, and they poisoned the first convert before he could be baptised. Surely he still went to heaven?

I say those who are not saved are not saved on account of their own sins.  It is not because God did not give them sufficient grace, for He does do so, in His desire that all men might be saved.  However, as only some are saved - and those who are saved are saved by the grace of God, "not by works, lest any man should boast" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to heed the call of God.  They are damned by their own free will and chosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not predestined, but reprobated instead. >so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed >and not where it isn't?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved, >and nothing in between.  hmmmm. Certainly God does not distribute grace evenly.  If He did, no one could have their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing God to withdraw His grace).  But, you are correct - the world is divided into those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the road to perdition.  THe key is that God knows it and we do not.  Thus, no one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect and predestined.  But no one who is a Christian in good standin should doubt their salvation either (that shows a lack of trust in God). >be punished after we die.  you're saying what we get after we die has >a direct bearing on how we live now?  strange.... You must admit it is possible.  Anyway, why would you want something in the hear and know, when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven?  Better to lay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said. This is not to condemn the rich, but simply to point out that those who are rich are frequently very evil or immoral, so God must give them their blessing know, as they have chosen.  Remeber, Jesus promised tribulation in this world, and hatred of others because we are Christians.  He did not promise heaven on earth.  He promised heaven. >so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if it's > sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine? Not really.  Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it in Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15).  Those with poorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved through fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for whatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)).  Of course, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing of the Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is really little excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the somewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul. And no comments were taken as flames.  You are one of the more polite people I have talked to over the net. Andy Byler ps.

The Arena's been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just take winning for granted.  It's been seemingly forever since the team lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory. While I'm glad to have the Pens doing so well, in some ways it was a better high back when the Pens beat the Bruins two years ago, and the Rangers last year. Too much of a good thing is not always good for you. rick

Fox was on Letterman about a year ago (or two) during the  playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins.  While he's not exactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's legs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident.  It was quite amusing, as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew what he was talking about.  Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey player is?  Michael Douglas (aka Michael Keaton)?

>When Elizabeth greeted Mary, Elizabeth said something to the effect that >Mary, out of all women, was blessed.  If so, it appears that this >exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity. I remember a couple of times when my ex-girlfriend said that she thought she was blessed because of her son (whom she loved dearly). In fact, I've heard people refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times. It's a common figure of speech. Considering that Elizabeth was just another human, I think this passage offers nothing towards justifying the "blessedness" of Mary.

(Darin Johnson) writes: >Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity? I'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it: 	What's more important to Christians?  Love of God or love 	of other human beings? to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like the other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any "flavor" of Christianity which would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a "priority" over the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let the dead bury the dead, to "hate" family rather than let it keep us from following Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our fellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us to the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different level than the one who is so caught up in "love" of God. The trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it has sometimes been the case that the Church has "taught" that all sex was nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental homes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the vehicle of becoming "one flesh" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what is wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I mean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social interaction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of marriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and foster the children they beget and support their children's mothers. This is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation of that passage.) 	[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as 	  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes 	  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not 	  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the 	  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are 	  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of 	  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ] Yes, of course it sometimes goes "wrong" -- like all else we do, it is infected with sin, and you find married "couples" where there is no bond, and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond formation (the "infatuation", "falling in love" phase) that they break any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep unity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away. Satan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love -- but in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's grace under the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem for Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil is watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.) So, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that sex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable to him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the hard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to each other -- seemed somehow to undercut the "proper" preparation for an immediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should act *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our mates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause of the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints have the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication, mind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual life in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in the type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We are human, and little good comes of trying to "mortify the flesh" to the point of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings. >Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex >completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, It depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy on the part of those who find us "stumbling blocks" I am much less of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins. There are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift, and maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that seems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read as demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our conspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop to the full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded in sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance; telling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?) is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our spiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of speaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet another prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some *particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies. --  Michael L. Siemon		I say "You are gods, sons of the     - or -			you shall die like men, and fall

But Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat.  That's quite different from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like the usual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he does. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of  Lazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that a fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice and isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good  reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal  hell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between  God and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not built on Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear were removed, there would BE no foundation.   That's basically why it matters to me.  I think we have many Christians  that DON'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God. I cannot be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if my response to God is motivated on fear.   --  ------- Lawrence Overacker Shell Oil Company, Information Center    Houston, TX            (713) 245-2965

   Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current     status of his research would be appreciated. Burzynski's work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-5 antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against leukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985) Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1 and A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been extracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually distinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10 against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous system, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested. It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's theory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to PAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying peptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1 mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10 does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy. Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early research, past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue. sdb ---

Hi guys.... What happened? 	1.  Potvin didn't let six goals by. 	2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up. 	3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs 		the emotional edge. 	4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs. 	A couple of comments: 	stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted 	the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth 	place....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for 	accumulating points from the three star selection) during the 	regular season. 	2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this 	one.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is 	one of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the 	officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever 	missed that slash on Gilmour's hand). 	3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better 	chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better 	against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the 	division). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm 	supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D 	By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not 		playing aggressive hockey.... 	By the way....I'm not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be. 		I just like watching a good matchup. 	tee hee hee...ooops! 	Susan

Not to this degree. >Calling shuttle flight characteristics *bizarre* in the same post  >as touting DC-X is interesting.   Why? >DC-X will also have similar "zero-defects" issues (am I wrong?).   Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle isn't reusable, it's salvagable). >I am thinking of how DC-X will deploy a chute or reverse orientation at  >supersonic speeds.   The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change. >How much in DC-X is redundant?  That's the real question. The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available thrust and still land safely. >Everything we do in life has zero-defects issues at times (agree?). Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same thing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is. >As a doctor, I can not error in my diagnosis and treatment recommendations.   You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you? >While DC-X's R&D program makes good sense, I am less optimistic about DC-X  >as you (and apparently others) are.   You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do need to do to build SSTO. >But, DC-X will still have failures.  It is the nature of aerospace R&D.   Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't. >It's successors are not slated to be passenger carrying.   Not true.

:>Can anyone out there tell me the difference between a "persistent" disease :>and a "chronic" one? For example, persistent hepatitis vs chronic :>hepatitis. : :I don't think there is a general distinction.

I beg to differ.  Chronic *active* hepatitis implies that the disease remains active, and generally leads to liver failure.  At the very minimum, the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes (what some call "transaminitis").  Chronic *persistant* hepatitis simply means that the patient has HbSag in his/her blood and can transmit the infection, but shows no evidence of progressive disease.  If I had to choose, I'd much rather have the persistant type. --  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   = =  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!" = =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Some years ago -- possibly as many as five -- there was a discussion on numerology.  (That's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add up the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another.  I can never make any sense of how it's supposed to work or what it's supposed to prove.) Somebody posted a long article about numerology in the Bible, saying things like "this proves the intricate planning of the Scriptures, else these patterns would not appear". Then there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the other numerology posts.  Stuff like "The word `numerology' adds up to 28, and the word appears 28 times in the posting!  Such elegant planning! Further, the word `truth' ALSO adds up to 28; the writer is using these numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!" (These examples are made up by me just as examples.) I really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showing that these patterns can be found in just about anything.  However, I did not save a copy of it.  I do not remember the author.  I'm only 90% sure that it was posted to this newsgroup. BUT, on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it, or that the author is reading here, I wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy.  (I think it should be made into an FAQ, if we can find it.)

Just some thoughts: I don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player, but this time I couldn't resist.  During the Pens-Devils game last night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in the penalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face, then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself!  All Kjell could do, at 8'7" and 355 pounds, was laugh! And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a little out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've always supported the argument "he does his job by being irritating," but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course, Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either. It seems that he was following the "The only way to beat the Penguins is to injure them" philosophy. As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day, Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night, and last night as well, although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end was pretty exciting.

I wrote a letter the other day to Empower America - the organization which claims to be championing conservative issues, esp. in the wake  of the Republican defeat last fall.  Some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of  support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run. You'd be close to the truth. Their two leading spokesmen are Bill Bennett, former 'Drug Czar' who heartily supported Bush's semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough -  who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - and Jack Kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans.  These are conservatives ?  Anyway I thought it interesting that when I ran Word Perfect's spell check against my letter - it came up with the following corrections for 'Bennett' : 1. Banned 2. Bayonet Needless to say, I found these choices rather amusing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "It [collectivism vs individualism] is an ancient conflict.

>>This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since >>both have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot >>enter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they >>cannot enter into Heaven. > >Are you saying that baptism has nothing to do with asking Jesus to come into >your heart and accepting him as your savior, but is just a ritual that we >must go through to enable us to enter Heaven?    I don't think Joe was saying any such thing.  However, your question on "asking Jesus to come into your heart" seems to imply that infants are not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always be viewed by some people as a sort of "prodigal son" type of thing; i.e. a sudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly accepting Christ?  Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly after birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does a man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From my experiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built, including one's relationship with God.    Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a ritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the recipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ it is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itself bestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption into God's family on the soul. -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University

Gorden  >Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize  >the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use  >and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to  >restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is  >yet a standard part of medical practice.     Nor is it mine.  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections.  Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and biochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining "good" anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part of my routine practice to "reinnoculate" patients with "good" bacteria after antibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a "logical extension" from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials.    One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate the patients flora.  Don't try this at home.  >not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.

Through the recent New England J of  >Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong,  >increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is  >restricting calcium intake.   Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical trial, like:  AU   Dismukes-W-E.  Wade-J-S.  Lee-J-Y.  Dockery-B-K.  Hain-J-D. TI   A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the      candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments] SO   N-Engl-J-Med.  1990 Dec 20.  323(25).  P 1717-23.      psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens      and the all-placebo regimen      significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than      0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms      significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ]      CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis      hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or      psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently,      the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such      women appears to be unwarranted.   Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.  Jon Noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despite Crook's recommendation for Nystatin).  Maybe they didn't avoid those carbohydrates . . .  >The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to  >be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. >If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans  >David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider  >yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as  >Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast  >infections should decline.   Marty, you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with systemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about "real" candida infections, the whole "yeast connection" hypothesis, the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We can't seem to focus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.                                        I'm lost!

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed, but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the thyroid that would cause depression. Note that weight gain is usually a symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid condition is present. I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output, but I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all. The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) on the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 - one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in the liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other hormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in short order. Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-) and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local library). I hope this has been of some help. -Eileen Bauer

But Deborah says (Judges 5:24):  > Blessed among women shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite,  > Blessed above all women in the tents. It can doubtless be taken that Jael's slaying of Sisera was a type of Mary's victory over sin. But even if we take Deborah's words as applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary, they must still be applicable literally to Jael.  We may well take them to mean that God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His people, and that she has this in common with Mary.  But we have no reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless, and thus no reason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she was sinless.  Yours,  James Kiefer

The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the  building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit  for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims  that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped into the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours. I don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CS gas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY  uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in  the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less  eat.  So my question now is "why were they cooking food?"    I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire. But that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more crazy than the ATF/FBI claim). Michael

And let us not forget that context is often an 	important factor in evaluating a situation.  Seeing disheveled persons 	on a hiking trail is not likely to be evaluated equally with meeting 	a grimey sort, as described above, on a lonely city street at 3 am.

Why is this so?  Have you any 	legitimate basis for this?  Any first-hand experience that lends 	validity to your fears?  Or are your fears based on mediated experience, 	i.e. the anecdotes of others such as network news?  I trust you can 	see the lack of legitimacy in such mediated inputs? 	And why are you afraid of the PEOPLE as mentioned above?  Forgive me, 	but you sound afraid to the point of paranoia.  Perhaps you should talk 	to someone about this.  I am not saying this to be rude or fascetious, 	but I think anyone with fear as deep and baseless as yours *seems* to 	be needs some sort of help.

Iridology is descendant from a 19th-century theory which mapped certain diseases to sectors of the iris of the eye.  There's enough natural variation in color that a skilled examiner can find indicators of virtually any disease. Modern scientists consider it to be complete bunk.

Add Boston's WEEI-590AM as the Bruins' flagship station. You probably won't pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a 5,000 watt station. The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England states. This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an all-sports radio station. The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy being moved over to a different station(WMEX 1150AM) whenever there is a the same-night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics. This happened 28 times during the course of the regular season.(The Celtics own financially troubled WEEI). The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year. Stay tuned. -PPV Mark

> hi all, Ive applied for the class of 93 at quite a number of schools (20) > and have gotten 13 rejects, 4 interviews and 3 no responses. Three possible results after interview: 1) rejection outright 2) acceptance outright 3) the infamous 'wait list'...  If you are on a 'wait list', your entrance into medical school is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their acceptance.  This can happen as late as day -1 of starting classes.   > Any one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters? > According to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out > the number of their class in acceptances by mid March. Whats going on... I > am losing my sanity checking my mailbox every day. You can always call the admissions office.  The secretaries should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your application.  Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries have more power than you might realize, and you never know- could be the dean of admissions answering the phone. > Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i If you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate yourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing you into medicine; your academic and extracurricular accomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really* want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant other.   If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no, sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I have turned down writing recommendations for some students because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them at that point.   Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof-reading and get their criticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you say it. Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor in some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut courses, it usually shows. Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus; substantial leadership roles in an organization help also. Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to spot and weed out. Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal of skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in applying to any program, medical or what-have-you. Good luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting is the hardest part', at least emotionally. :) Bob Schmieg
Okay, the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they do, does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals' futility record in the playoffs? I remember that Terry's first year was the first year that the Caps finally made it to the third round but before under Brian, I noticed that every other year the Caps got to the second round and the years in between they didn't make it past the first round. Is this trend continuning?  The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan. P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders!

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!

The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like Flatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If last night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an  Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game against the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third period goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game winner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity for years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just like the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!!

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada. The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time, it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room. It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they  have it.

Clinicians may not have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find themselves named in a suit. If there is no response within a week send a follow up letter. Attach a photocopy of the original letter. Do this weekly until you do get a response. CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. The scanner can be a bad place for the claustrophobic. There was an interesting study in the BMJ, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% of people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would never have another.

Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it is when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding the pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not propel the bullet with any significant velocity. In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded cartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough to take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe. Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.                                -- Alane --    /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    "I am a jelly doughnut"      \  /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \ /-----------------------------------------------------------------------\

>For a reasonable sum, you can get a BMW with traction control: >a torque-sensing (limited slip) rear differential.   "traction control" as far as the optional feature that one buys with cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential. a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD, but not all LSD's are torque sensing.  viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to viscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing. for that matter, so are "traction control" systems that use ABS sensors and pulse braking. then there are the older posi-tracs and whatever which i am not familiar with the workings. eliot

So their lack of value is just your opinion, not an actual fact, which is neither a philisophical or legal basis for prohibiting them. On the other hand, I lived in OakBrook IL for a while, where zoning laws prohibit billboards, as you mention above.  I think it was a fine law, despite it's contradictory basis. I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would be violation of private property.  "I bought this house, out in the boondocks, specifically to enjoy my hobby, amateur astronomy.  Now this billboard has made that investment worthless, so I want the price of the property, in damages."

I don't have a concordance here but I have >some dim memory that this appears *somewhere* in the Bible. >Given a fairly specific context for what judgement is, I'd say >that more or less decides the issue. > >[Heb 9:27 --clh] Indeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:   26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often   since the foundation of the world; but now once at   the consummation He has been manifested to put away    sin by the sacrifice of Himself.   27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die   once, and after this comes judgement;   28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear   the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to   bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him. The first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context, the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ's sacrifice, "once", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen  mankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his  "Christianity and Reincarnation".  The thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and  sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual  experience of the human being after death.  The "once"  is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity  of Christ's deed.  One thing for certain it does is to  refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than  once.  But the comparison to the human experience - die  once, then judgement (note: not "the judgement", but just  "judgement".  The word for judgement is "krisis". Hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this point, I would just emphasize again that the  passages  that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably they are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of Hebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context, namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death. What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And there are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc- tion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2. We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them. But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist and "new age" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ as the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences; the redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of the body, and the Last Judgement. Taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their sins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to  works, the meaning of "deathbed conversion", the meaning of the sacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and  Redeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such  as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence. There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible  does not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others)  could not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole of humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the greater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes,  not the end of man's sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and the New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.

  Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely.  I am on an information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of Christianity/churches there are.           My husband and I come from very different, but completely Christian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a born and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot of what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical based Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based. However over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the Church of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are socio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine. One of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through Mary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but in the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I am told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that verse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men (ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw was when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the study. Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church feels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL Christian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call themselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are also don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new "movement" being led by the young people. So, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter what their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women). Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious convictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still bring their Bibles to service. We are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and without reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be thrilled! I'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and even harder for me to stay churchless for long. any responses would be welcome the diel family [I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what you're looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of the flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the denomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sort of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum. Historically that's been associated with movements that have the character you're trying to avoid.  --clh]

I have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings.  Some say the lead/ mercury leeches into your system and this is bad.  And I have recently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.    My dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where I have two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both. He says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large. So, I would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam and composite.  And, should I really even be worried about amalgam?  I heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more-  is this true. Any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Dave Childs

I'd be willing to bet that a majority of the cost difference could be accounted for by the AF's requirement for superfluous 2167 documentation, 5 or 6 huge requirements and design reviews, travel expenses flying personnel around to meetings, and over specifying the hardware. I doubt that the actual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different from SDIO's costs. Of course, this is my cynical opinion based on years of watching the government procurement process try to cover up a lack of creativity and innovation with reams of documentation. ;)
I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer. Here are the team goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993 These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those are not verified.   If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

16. What is the condition of the propane tank mentioned by the BD survivors? I.e. is it crushed and does it have tread marks on it? --  The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the elimination of personal freedom.

I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team.   I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season, and   then never touched the roster again.  I got wrapped up in my own "money" pool   and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew   btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and   maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of   curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my   amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to   finsh 79th!

    The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules.  Overtime time games     that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would     have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin     with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof!     However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the     ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break     whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the     deal with ESPN, they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this     would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L.     should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the     N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the     damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to     watch!  They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get.  We must     let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody     out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know.     Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it....     Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall     on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the     3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the     front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was     doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall     to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for     holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about     hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player     had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,     Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that     really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,     on the resulting PP and     eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the     outcome of a game.     They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking     obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones. This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat. However, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace their balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got any.     All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.     Steve     
But after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights, doesn't it start to have a paradoxical effect?  I used to take one every night for allergies and couldn't figure out why I developed bad insomnia.  Finally figured out it was the antihistamines.  I would fall asleep for a few minutes but would awaken at the drop of a pin a little later and could not get back to sleep.  I don't have that problem since I stopped the antihistamines at bedtime.  ? Alice

David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic, 'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or part of the Oort cloud. Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there isn't a mechanism for the others either. Keith Harwood.
If this man Clark is a NASA administrator then god save NASA. Of course the Shuttles record is unrivaled !  There is only one Shuttle. Furthermore, there is only likely to be one Shuttle now that Hermes and Boron are  effectively cancelled. These officials should spend more of their time explaining to their European and Asian partners how we are expected to believe in them when their paymasters change their minds on major international projects everytime a new US administration takes office (considering the major impacts this has on the European and Asian (Japanese) industry). It is also appreciated how this affects American industry.

Actually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction of the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In this case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.   The record for acceleration, though, is measured along "the direction you're facing" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this record was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so. Eric Seale

The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem. A "quick look" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point. The clash between Jeremiah and the "false prophets" was primarily in the theological realm. The "false prophets" understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant, which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies. The "judgement prophesies" were deeply loaded with theological meaning. In my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson "New York will burn" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w--- | Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

>As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while  >here in Europe they are rare??? Just wondering..... Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This, along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a manual. (Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to drive through the slushbox.) As automatics become more efficient, the "bigotry" is probably reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there aren't compelling reasons to go automatic. -dB -- 
	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with  	Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither  	marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)? Footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit. Tobit is in the Septuagint. Goodspeed published it in a book called  "The Apocrypha". Most any bookstore will have this. At any rate, the Jews  of Christ's day had this book. It is a story mostly centered around the son of Tobit who was named Tobias. There was a young lady, Sarah, who had  entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. The brothers  all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage. Tobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife (3:17) because Tobias was her only relative and "...she was destined for [Tobias] from the beginning" (6:17). Tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. The  seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. That does not  eliminate Tobias, her eighth husband. Tobit is a fun and interesting  story to read. It's kind of a mythical romance. It's a little shorter  than Esther. The LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20. Most  notably Doctrines and Covenants 132:15-16. 	"Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry  	her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as 	he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage 	are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of  	the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they  	are out of the world. 	"Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor  	are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which 	angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are  	worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of  	glory."   Cordially, Charles Dike

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book "Colon Cleansing for Health and Longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics, along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts the immune system to a significant degree. He also plugs a unique appliance called the "Colema Board", which facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over $100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash, supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its bulkiness. If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very interested to hear about research and personal experience. This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon fasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification. -- Eli --  /-------------------------------------------------------------------------\ \-------------------------------------------------------------------------/

I would also be interested in finding out about the '94 Talon, and I suspect that many other people would be interested too, so let's get some responses on the net.

However, his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up big when it counts.  The score was 4-0 I think when the goal you mentioned was scored.  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming back, Chevy was exceptional.  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff goalie:  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line, but comes up big when really needed.  I guess we'll both find out.

D&C 68:25-28; note that this >>passage applies it only to members of the LDS church). I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others may not have the reference. "And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents." What is "the sin" of the parents? >Hi Bruce.  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 18? >Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins is the one who will die.  The son will not >share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the >son.  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and >the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." >Is Ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps? Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle. However, it assumes that fathers and sons have  equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment. Parents are responsible to teach their children the Gospel and other life skills.  Should they fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their  children, the parent would be held responsible -- not for their children's sins, but for not teaching them properly. Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position  of authority in either the family or the church He expects that person to teach those in his charge. In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others  is likened to "a watchman unto the house of Israel." "If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from  his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to  turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul." Even though the D&C prefaces this commandment with "parents have children in Zion" I believe all parents are responsible for teaching their children  whatever good principles they understand. However, LDS parents accept greater responsbility and could be judged more strictly. A IDLER

I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applied to about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to hear from the other school. Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything,  but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund on your $50 application fee. But, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it an acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How did your interviews go? As for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted me for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection letters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are still interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become fixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself. What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very mediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software engineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still, I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this: VERY IMPORTANT -------------- GPA:	3.5 or better MCAT:   top 15% in all subject MEDIUM IMPORTANCE ----------------- Writing/Speaking ability Maturity Motivation for going into medicine Activities LESS IMPORTANT -------------- College or University Major Work experience Anything else you want them to know Anyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each person as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting  four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, you were able to impress them with your character. Good luck, Jeff

	Okay... here's some gripe"ing" (?griping?... whatever). 	(I live in Santa Barbara... for reference... I think) 	Okay, ABC showed the Kings/Flames... fine... YAWN. 	ESPN (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the   Red Wings/Toronto game... cool. 	But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that   ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday. 	I raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game, but   ALAS, it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would   show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday.  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind. 	I didn't mind THAT MUCH.  I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better   than NO hockey).  During the game their were no video highlights from the   Patrick division.  What the hell was going on?  At least they should show   video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was   so close).  My father (lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Bumbf*ck, Egypt])   got to watch the Pens game on ESPN.  I just don't get it. 	The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want   to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2, will turn on their TVs on Thursday   and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game   3.  At least, in my case, I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game. 	If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on   Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN, I'd be mad as   hell. 	Oh well... hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR   SOMETHING. Matt Coohill P.S.  The announcers for the Buffalo/Boston were the worst that I have 	ever heard (as far emotion goes).  They had the enthusiasm of 	"Droopy Dog".  I hope for better on Thursday.
Okay.  I have my copies of all relevant gun-control bills.  I'm mad as hell. I want to get involved.  I want to join the battle to protect our Second Amendment Rights. Who do I write?

This might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study, which I have begun reading, but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum, I will conclude here as well.  A week ago, I managed to find time to consult a Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library, and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as used in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the Jewish scriptures. The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal noun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning "lover."  This cluster occurs just where one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation) of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea 2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel 16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22. 	[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and 	  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not 	  likely written by, Jeremiah. ] The "erotic" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is evident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like "of the arts" the word "lover" is going to have an overtone of sexual relationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see that standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the Hebrew! :-) More interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine usage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say), _eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very valuable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd context -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be "say." In addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs), Esther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application,  	kai e:rasthe" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther and, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan: 	kai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra 	-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely 	[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I 	  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ] (The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about the "historical" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of the Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the "erotic" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_ for erotic senses, this need not mean anything "more" than _agapao:_ alone would mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this translator goes!) --  Michael L.

The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure, a nun of the sisters of Charity on July 18, 1830 at Rue du Bac, Paris. Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5 or 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light.  The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised the Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her. Our Lady appeared to her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining to her life and to the future of France and the world. On November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructed her to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this  medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would receive great graces. In less than a year there were three more apparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports were received by those who wore it. Within two years of its issuing the medal was known as the "Miraculous Medal". Catherine died in 1876. Her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). She was canonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at the motherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with Our Lady. The apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor. Above the altar, a pyramid painted to represent God's all knowing wisdom looked down on them. Our Lady's feet rested on a white globe and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was stepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world. Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed  Catherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword represented her suffering with Jesus. The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned that a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition  leading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets. And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute with the forces of the dark. She told Catherine "The times are evil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will be overturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of all kinds." Refer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages. A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores. I will post other Marian events every few days or so including the ones happening today which are still under investigation. These postings serve only to introduce you to these events. Please look more into them and understand the reason for  the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: My opinions.

In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised, of course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that  shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot.

FLAME ON Reading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling) photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the narrow-minded, "I know it all", "I don't believe what I can't see or measure" attitude of many people out there. I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to so-called "paranormal" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis. I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame of reference. History shows that many great people, great scientists, were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics. Especially the USA should be grateful; after all, Columbus did not drop off the edge of the earth. FLAME OFF, or end sermon :-) -- Alex
Hi Stephen Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some  hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your own, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up) and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and   firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl  under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever you may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse it out. Good Luck -heather

Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12 deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients, systemic candida infection.  I think "The Yeast Connection" is a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well nutrition is taught, anyway? > >Here is a brief primer on yeast.

Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds,  depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.   >  >Martin Banschbach, Ph.D. >Professor of Biochemistry and Chairman >Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology >OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine >1111 West 17th St. >Tulsa, Ok. 74107 > You're the chairman of Biochem and Micro and you didn't know  that a yeast is a form of a fungus?

[This was crossposted to a zillion groups.  I don't intend to carry an entire discussion crossposted from alt.sex, particularly one whose motivation seems to be having a fun argument.  However I thought readers might be interested to know about the discussion there.  --clh] I intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it.  I intend to show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this statement.  I intend to also show that such a declaration can be  made without there being a religious justification for morality, in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist. Anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side, i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral, or that, collaterally, it is a morally valid practice, is free to do so.  I think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it. This should be fun to try and figure this out, and I want to try and expose (no pun intended) my ideas and see other people's and see where their ideas are standing.  As I'm not sure what groups would be interested in this discussion, I will be posting an announcement of it to several, and if someone thinks of appropriate groups, let me know. If someone on here doesn't receive alt.sex, let me know and I'll make an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as I'll use that as the main forum for this.  By "exception to usual policy" is that I normally charge for this, but for the duration the service will be available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on Internet or Bitnet. I decided to start this dialog when I realized there was a much larger audience on usenet / internet than on the smaller BBS networks. To give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger, this will  begin on Monday, May 24, to give people who want to make the response time to identify themselves.  Anonymous postings are acceptable, since some people may not wish to identify themselves.  Also, if someone else wants to get in on my side, they are free to do so.   This should be *much* more interesting than Abortion debates!

Don't lie to yourself and >believe Ford will forfeit that. The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my "car circle" is that the  suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior. After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided  independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in  a volume car.   The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority.  Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro/Firebird, IMO.   I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will  achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptation to "just get them out the door" for the sake of positive cash flow will be  great once demand really takes off.   Tim Gardner

I remember one person in particular who passionately declared that the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the phenomena of the smooth sky distribution.

I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficult to fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired. Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound. Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex. Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago. The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the difference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite so expensive. USA

No, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch.  Indeed, this dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be retractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed to the array-flapping problems. The retrieval problems are exactly as stated:  it would be costly, would involve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not to re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination. --

She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about  what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.   For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since  Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette. our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims.

Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he started going to day care.  He was at home for the first year and he did not fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics 3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we are beginning to wonder how often "more often" really is, whether our son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are, and what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his day care and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether we should think about getting a nanny. Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions? -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick? How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data on home care vs. day care? -- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later), does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it not have any long term effect? -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effects? -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal, and what does one do about it? -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance? Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much appreciated.  Thanks a lot. Ashwin.

THE SOVIETS AND VENUS                                      PART 3                        Copyright (c) 1993 by Larry Klaes 	The author gives permission to any group or individual wishing 	to distribute this article, so long as proper credit is given,         the author is notified, and the article is reproduced in its          entirety.         To the North Pole!         On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON      rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan      Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe      for the planet Venus.          Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing     yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the     planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic     VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core     was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of     propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by     the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels     were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large     amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The     dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger      to properly transmit this information to Earth.          Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed     the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)     POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a     terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by      the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'     surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles).          The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over     the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects      no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the     VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations      made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the      island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern     pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or      PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially      interesting geological features worthy of investigation.         On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330      million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections,      VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a      polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around      the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA      16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus'      first polar-circling spacecraft.         Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20      for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north     pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers      (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.       The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over      the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back      to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took      eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions      in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers      (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.         VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more     complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills,      mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape,      many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the      last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean      surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the      largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids      would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles)      across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.         There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists     on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes'      owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the      summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest      mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American      scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell      was a huge volcano sitting on the northern "continent" of Ishtar Terra.           In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about     Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later     in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar     (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-     nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be      called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan      (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even      finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet      probes maintained that distinction.         Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted     next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the      Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's     temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about     five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few     locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating      current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds      over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles)      lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty      kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees      warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.         When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were      plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at      more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to      pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control     gas to perform the operation.           VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving      the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six      hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an      atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.         Venus by Balloon         For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting      target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of      air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of      the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)     had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint      French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless,      late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.         When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21,      the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full      views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe      since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.         The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named     VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei     being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft      have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one      celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.           This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to      the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.     Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from     the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists      around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such      bodies which actually come close to Earth.           Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar      system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall      in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice      and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar      encounter.         The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and     Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not     wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a     close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical     GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the      comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and      SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance.          Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet     from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel     powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget     cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to     make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of      data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter      and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor      John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.         The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building     an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify     their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an      advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,     the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of      the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the      U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier.      The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the      location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive      in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.         As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA     1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander     making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the     upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers     (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released     by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)     altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had     successfully arrived.          One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was     pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a     diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen     meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as     an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat     consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment     point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,     and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for     measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special     white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which     permeated the planet's atmosphere.          The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just     north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag      would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened      hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.       This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as      well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.       The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar      to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists      had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight      due to the permanently thick cloud cover.         The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day     hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600     kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did     not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer     (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers     (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three     main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the     balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers     (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and     down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the     journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius     (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.     The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.          Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already     headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with     a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13      and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the     composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the     Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen     minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to      accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6      miles) above the surface.          There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before     touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not     only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of     Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never      before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature      and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees      Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's      56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background      infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.         As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and      12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data     returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The     French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine,      and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active      volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.     The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air     between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)     contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.         The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks      appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.     The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results     nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers      instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were      three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50      and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a     thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles),      much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-     cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air      over the last seven years.         When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last      functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on     for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around     the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March     6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the      dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.     The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial     bodies with one space vessel.         On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for     a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2     balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking     it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning     side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)     flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still     environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.     After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent      for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-     kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the "continent" of Aphrodite      Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5      miles) towards the surface.         Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air      layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius      (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1     balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed      through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning     were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer      failed to function.         The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite     Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900     miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother     than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a     relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in     working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite,      rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in      aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree      of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured      463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,     essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.         Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at     a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin      to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030      kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet      is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers      (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three      hours.         Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley     encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the      probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-     Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance      of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets      had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly      a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was      not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.       VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.         Future Plans Diverted         The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous      ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second      world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for     the early 1990s.         This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple      probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft      would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon      probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's      corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over      the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to      investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible      landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main      Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.         Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in     the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA     mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet     and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space      program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction      was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this      class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next      year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on     Mars' largest moon, Phobos.          All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,     including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and      eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.     The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious     consideration of human colonization in the near future.         But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars     exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,     one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other     going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon     landing in March of 1989.          In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to     ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the     mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put      on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have     since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of     continuous robotic exploration of the planet.          During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change     was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began      to "open up" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with      the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the      culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking      a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a "free market".         These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.     Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making     almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring     nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to      make money.           In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for      sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price      of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary      probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United      States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.         MAGELLAN and GALILEO          The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration     with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.     Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of     spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most      detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When     MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be     able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108     meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.         In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space      Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit      the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle      ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space,      named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the      probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.         In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on     a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around     Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach     Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary     goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the     planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in     that violent atmosphere.         On the Drawing Boards         With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,     new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-     tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet      Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1,      1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions      within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also     considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.         In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects      as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes     throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected     for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing     of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air     temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed     to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air     with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.     Final project decisions will be made in 1994.         Humans on Venus               Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?     At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure     would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something     even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into     changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like     Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking     will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide      atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability      to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster     than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries     if not millennia.         In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand     Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how     a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became     instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?     Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found     through international cooperation, including the nation which      made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

On the subject of the V4,Ford in the UK used V4 engines exstensively in their Ford Transit vans.This brings back a memory from the seventies.I played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of us bought a 1967 "tranny" to cart the gear around in.It was in terrible shape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.We spent days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried pig shit came flying out the vents!!!.     Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that thing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and it went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now.     When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a  Morris Minor that worked great. Ah fond memories. --  Paul W.

Pennicillin if i have everything correct,  was a highly valuable Myco-toxin,  discovered during WW2.  It proved to have an amazing Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   It's immediate administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving problems  that previously were fatal.  Although initially enormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years, the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude, and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive then aspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections. Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promised amazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease. It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and developement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 times of administration  and costs $2,000 per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost. The drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients. I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin, but to centoxin. pat

A lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible- distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The ACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action protected the "religious neutrality of our public schools." He also said that schools must serve students of "all faiths and none." Schools were not to be a "bazaar where rival religious groups compete for converts," according to Lynn. Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools. They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to continue their work at a distance, but find the school's position somewhat disheartening. I understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other hand, when does "neutrality" become "nihilism?" When does plurality turn into no position at all? I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment. The other is that while we are seeking "religious neutrality" in our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced "religious neutrality" for the past seventy years--are making the  Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St. Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100 public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the students and are given class time to explain its contents. I remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and speaking to the university students standing under a statue of Lenin. Now, that's ironic! I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public arena acknowledges it as valid. However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our schools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make moral and ethical decisions.

Good column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree with moral education from home, but some homes don't have the kinds of morals I want taught.

We've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now.  We precede any orbiting mission with flyby missions.  Of course, it gets harder to do as we work our way farther away from Earth.

Well first things first. We'll do a flyby mission first since it is much easier and faster to do.  If the Fast Pluto Flyby mission is approved then we'll launch a Pluto mission before the end of the decade.  A Pluto orbiter however requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period.   Orbit insertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts the trajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto. I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbiting mission before a Pluto orbiting mission, unless the Pluto flyby turns up something really interesting.      ___    _____     ___     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.
I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295 down to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I got pneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well; cholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized over time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch to Mevicore.   On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108,  and HDL was 35; but the trig's were still very high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal,  SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35). He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("Just to be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem."), and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of. Should the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens to folks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the above results?  Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenient  side effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?  (Niacin affected my  liver, too).

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ****** ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's health care system, federal health officials said Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases. Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled "Emerging Infectious Diseases" to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community. The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments. "This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it," said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases. There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic, the first in this century, she said. Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem. "We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past" Berkleman said.  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment. "Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States," the CDC said. It  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newly identified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome. "The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas," the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance. =====*===== SOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1 HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage: legal liability. A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property. The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical expenses and lost wages. Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L. Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable. Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant. But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one. The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease. Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and lost earnings. The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease. Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn & Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help to establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme disease." Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten. The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites. A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites. Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness. Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease. And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes. Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last year, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson & Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical- supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected. Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole Katz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their 100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing pesticide. =====*===== TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease. AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH, Department of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30 Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction. Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended. IV. ***** QUESTIONS 'N' ANSWERS ***** editor.   When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the compost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became infected.   A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to back that claim up with documentation.  Do lyme-carrying ticks hang out in compost heaps? Thank you.

Hello again, another question.  :) I just got my hands on 2 quarts of ReadLine Gear Oil (at $7 a quart) now I need to know how to throw it into my car. I own an 89 NIssan Maxima Se, any Ideas? Can I mix the Oil in there with this stuff, or should I drain first, then 	only use this stuff. If you know where (if there is one) the drain plug on the manual transmission 	on the Maxima is, I would really appreciate any comments. Also have any of you Maxima owners, thied this stuff in your cars? Thanks in ADV. Sammy

  Easy vs. Hard .....Easy on who? I had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year.  She said that when she and my father were raising we four children, they did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised in their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be alienated from them and it would create problems.   In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They raised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable demands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.   What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and never absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God never involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that I may someday be held responsible for the things that offended Him...sins that the "world" told me were OK.   My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised four extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more complete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice and punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many grave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married and divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for change...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place ) and more....   My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing us to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or counsel.   Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they *did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and difficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able to say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and compassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not want to hear and will stay away from you.   This life is "but dust". As long as the comfort of this life is our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those with whom we come in contact.   I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who support the "right" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality, or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in this time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving friend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that what I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me living the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent people. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..) It is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer life to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend. Think about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that a friend is in error, but you don't want to "cause trouble". Righteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are we are Christ's lips and hands on earth. Don't be afraid to simply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a fervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance. In more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's keeper. In Jesus and Mary, Elizabeth
> I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for > Humans.  I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere > evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question > is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions. This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive answer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material. On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered). This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere. There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about it. 	Paul F. Dietz
>There is a paragraph in the New Testament which in my opinion, clearly makes >a positive inference to reincarnation. I don't remember which one it is off of >the top of my head, but it basically goes like this: Jesus is talking with the >apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can  >come Elijah must first come. Jesus replies that Elijah has come, but they did  >not recognize him. It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering  >to John the Baptist. This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation. This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijah would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and did not actually die).  However Jesus was referring to John the Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John (remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to Elijah.  John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom.  The verses that describe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references about Elijah.  Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering Servant in Isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself. A brief reply but I don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff. Suffice to say there is a very strong explanation.

For those who didn't figure it out, the below message was a reply to another in sci.crypt, for which the poster put t.p.g. in the Followup-To line. I didn't notice that. Apologies to those who were confused. The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages. However, I don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yet another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that I disagree both with the interpretation of "well-regulated" in the Second Amendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion of the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control, and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter a special interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference in which "well regulated" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', and not under control/disciplined, etc. Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not an 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know many do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular forum. To avoid flames, or unproductive rehashings, I note that I've come in here to post this one message, just to clarify the one below. I'm now outta here again though I'm available via e-mail.

Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling class can afford.  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason to levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven different fees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically, I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's like Hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle. I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone else, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society, of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, the car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.
>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but >what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33. >     I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since.  The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed. (autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance) Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or using a numerical method. anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:             Cd = d/(q*2R)        where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius of the clyinder.    To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that the car would need to overcome.       -Bp

Hi, Thought I'd add something to the conversation.  My girlfriend used to work in a lab studying different natural carcinogens. She mentioned once about the cancerous effect of barbecued food. Basically, she said that if you eat barbecued foods with strawberries (a natural carcinogen) the slight carcinogenic properties of both cancel out each other. -- Jeff Poupore --  Jeff Poupore

This includes what the government says that    two survivors have said. 2) What Koresh's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says,    including what he says that most of the survivors have said. Strange, but they seem to disagree in most important particulars. If anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors speaking first-hand, feel free ot pitch in.  I may have missed it. But my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like case 2, and not at all like case 1. --

Note that "scientific evidence" in this area does not prove any conclusions. There has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's brains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little. Also notice that the apostles did not have with them the "scientific evidence" linking certain genes with alcoholism, or stealing with certain genetic problems.  Even if they did have scientific evidence, I doubt it would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the Holy  Spirit that these things are sinful. This reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine.  He said  something very true.  Christianity teaches that we should not give in to our every inclination.  Most people do give in to their leanings. In Christianity, we have the concept of struggling with the flesh, and bringing it into submission.  One person may have a problem with his temper, and having a murderous heart, another may have a problem with homosexuality, another may be inclined to greed.  But God offers us the opportunity to be more than conquerers. >sources where you can find this information, there is homosexual >behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals, which is in itself >suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned, or at least that >the word "unnatural" shouldn't really apply....

Someone referred to my FAQ essay on homosexuality.  Since it hasn't been posted for some time (and I've modified it somewhat since the last time), I'm taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another entry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They can be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as pub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far more detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though primarily from a conservative point of view. ---------------------------- This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and Christians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the question each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize the postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people asking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most common -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is "how can a Christian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about it?" First, on the definition of 'homosexual'.  Many groups believe that there is a homosexual "orientation", i.e. a sexual attraction to members of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual sexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by most groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the term 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex. This is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups.  In this paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging in sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven't heard of any Biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remains celebate. I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be homosexual.  This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'.  It is not known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence suggesting each.  The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality is not a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of them is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help people move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is Exodus International".  The reports I've seen (and I haven't read the detailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the Presbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that these programs have very low success rates, and that there are questions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly are people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as important as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong believe it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact that it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant than the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If it's wrong, it's wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though. If it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more willing to forgive it. One more general background issue: It's common to quote a figure that 10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where this came from.  Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source of the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey, one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have most of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The percentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey Institute, based on data in the early seventies but not published until the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can't put my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online information for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog at Rutgers:    AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.     TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C. Kinsey. Wardell B.           Pomeroy [and] Clyde E. Martin. PUBLISHER Philadelphia, W. B. Saunders Co., 1948.

LC CARD    48005195 This figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even been found to hold true in several other cultures, as noted in the recent NEWSWEEK coverstory "Is this child gay?" (Feb. 24, 1992).  A journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting her book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study, but the scholarly world seems to take her for a kook...... I've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study, but not in enough detail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another view, I'd be willing to include it.) Most Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong. Not all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan Community Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to accept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows it, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal Church seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that have congregational government, you'll find a few congregations that accept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably only one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches permit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is another issue.  I don't have any doubt that there are homosexual pastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others. As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here's an attempt to summarize the issues: The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of homosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell: "Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality", U Chicago Press, 1980. The argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws in the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on homosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g. the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was homosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults. (There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since the entities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying because it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in that culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot offered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to allow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance for references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you'll see that few seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There's a Jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any rate, there's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong. I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set of laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT justification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue. The NT references are all in Paul's letters.  A number of the references from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly vague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not mean homosexual.  Here's what he says: The two Greek words that appear in the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and /arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words actually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests "wanton" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous interpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was that in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has vanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less frowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He translates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none of the church fathers understood the term as referring to homosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the early Latin translations, would be "active mode homosexual male prostitute", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically. For a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on I Cor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate. However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not necessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated with some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee say taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very definite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it isn't a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against Boswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a translation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it is that the word is almost never used.  Paul's writing is the first occurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of "male" and "f**k" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since it doesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the action.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given. In theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It's dangerous to base meaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that "goodbye" is a religious expression because it's based on "God by with ye".  However since Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on "homosexual male prostitute", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something which Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation). In my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans 1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result of their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue that this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false gods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become heterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is what Paul meant. However I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom 1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it's homosexuality that appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness. Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I'm sure Paul does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex. Given his description of their situation, I rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality. But in all fairness, the "shameless" nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a specific feature of homosexuality. My overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have enough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of homosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality in passing. The result of this situation is that people interpret these passages in light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look to Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising that they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT prohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal, it is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view of homosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing without any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As readers of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the mouth when they see the opposing view described.  There's not a lot I can do as moderator about such a situation. A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of detailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact I'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their own beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the question of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modern homosexuality. One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act "straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions. Another is the following: In Paul's time homosexuality was associated with a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It was part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often occured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I'm not in a position to say that it always did, but there are some reasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active and passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult to act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two free adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal. Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children, slaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible partners.  (However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations in this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have been discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not involve slaves or children.) Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against homosexuality.  I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by promiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a homosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is not at risk for AIDS. Note that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative, apart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his use of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage as what God ordained. However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning against being too quick to deal with this issue legally. I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication. I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the views Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is not what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still conclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful or whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense due to human sinfulness.  If you're willing to consider the latter approach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it. The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail. This is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it. Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these conditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for homosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are actually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes AIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual relationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent to Christian heterosexual relationships.) In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we've heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in this situation.  I've also seen summaries of various research and the results of various efforts for "conversion".  (Aside from the Presbyterian report mentioned above, there's an FAQ that summarizes our readers' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that long-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a par with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to depend upon such a change is clear: When "conversion" doesn't happen, which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement of life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different context) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that judgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe homosexuality isn't God's original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love with each other. There's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this discussion.  The issue is that of "cultural relativism".  That is, when Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an eternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations in the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist on taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes subjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as relative? When looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completely rejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of judgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians consider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as clear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:   - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in 	the OT -- it's not in the NT, but I mention it here because 	until relatively recently the Church did consider it binding 	on Christians)   - prohibition against swearing oaths   - endorsement of slavery as an institution   - judgement of tax collectors as sinner We do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the argument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:   - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific 	agrarian society that the Bible was trying to build, 	but not to our market economy.   - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the 	same characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was 	concerned about   - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people 	how to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as 	an institution   - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to 	Roman tax farming The point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical prohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors. Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and many Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed, slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship between God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants or slaves of God.) I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally relative.  Rather, I'm trying to say that *some* things are, and therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in the Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the action we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the one that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against homosexuality are still binding, I'm willing to listen.  Those who claim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding themselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey all the rules listed above). One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue creates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence -- some laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is really idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose words are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among Christians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to people that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved. This is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments as conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I can't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way of justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a dangerous situation for Christians. On the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I have with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented. One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically determined.  I.e. "God made me homosexual", and I have no choice.  I think "God made me homosexual" is a fine view for people who already believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I don't see it as an argument for acceptability. Many people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug addiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn't mean it's OK. Most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people get angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be attraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if we view it as wrong) wouldn't be different than any of these other things.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular temptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say that because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus said, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying to self (which also appears throughout Paul's letters) seems to suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we are called on not to accept.  Paul's letters and the experience of Christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and the battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that homosexuality is difficult to fight doesn't necessarily say it's OK. Maybe this isn't the place where we have to die to self.  But I'd like to make sure that those who think it isn't are fighting the battle somewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-) However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago. ( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see ) I suppose that the "right" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration, but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially yukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although I do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing. --  __._____.___._____.__._______________________________________________________ __|_. ._| ._|_._._|__| Peter Card, Joint European Torus, Abingdon     | | | |_. | |    | Oxfordshire OX14 3EA UK. tel 0235-464867 FAX 464404   ._| | | |_. | |    | It wasnt me.

I have a few questions about the TAX on  a used car purchase. I live in New York State, and I am going to buy a used car. I know that I will have to pay tax when I go to register the car. But I would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or on the purchase price.  Also, what tax rate is used ?  The owner lives in Albany (8% tax), and I will be living in Saratoga with 7% tax.   Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50) One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ? Did I leave anything out ? What else might I have to know to purchase and register a used car ?  (I've never done this before.) Thank you, Peter Volpe

As long as a player is under contract to an organization, he is obligated to play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission to play. The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and Andersson to report to Binghampton.  It certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger  organization, however.

>I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers >have the right to a dark, uncluttered night sky.   Sorry, you have a _wish_ for an uncluttered night sky, but it isn't a right. When you get down to it, you actually have no rights that the majority haven't agreed to give you (and them in the process). It's a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with rights to this that and the other. Sadly this is not true.   Now if you want to talk about the responsibility that _should_ go with the power to clutter the night sky, then that's a different matter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Greg Nicholls ...         : Vidi

hi all, i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i shoulda went into more detail... Being my anxiety level is peaking and you folks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what you people think regarding my previous post. To recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were MD and 4 DO. as it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 MD and 2 DO), the results of which are 2 waiting lists (1 MD and one DO) 3 schools i heard nothing from at all. I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no info whatsoever to tell me. I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles and a few "safety"  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first to reject me) my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR I couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art history, politics etc  Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience. I cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. What percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average? I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm acceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the mailbox anxiety?

>    Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views  >children born out of wedlock?  In particular I'm interested to know if any  >stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents.   All children are born pure, i.e., without sin. However, most saints would view a pregnancy outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning. (Some church members would be much more judgmental, but that is *their* problem.) In situations where welfare assistance is  provided through our Church, bishops usually require that the family be making some effort to live the Gospel standards and provide for  themselves. However, there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home. As a former bishop of mine said, "Children are  always worthy before God." >I'm especially  >keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on  >bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical  >book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City.   I am not sure what you mean by the term "bastards" in this context. Latter-Day Saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity. If you use genealogical material or software produced by the Church, you may notice a section for "temple ordinances."  Within that section there should be a spot for signifying "BIC" which stands for "born in the covenant." The children born to couple sealed (married) within the temple are "born in the covenant" and are eligible to be part of that eternal family unit. Children born to other couples (whether in a civil marriage or not) would have to be sealed to their parents after their marriage is solemnized for eternity. Supposing a child were born to a woman out of wedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or her parents at a later date or adopted into  any eternal family unit (which may include one of the birth parents). >If this is an issue on which the  >"official" position has changed over time, I'm interested in learning both old  >and new beliefs.  E-mail or posting is fine.  All information or pointers are  >appreciated. I can't say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing  ordinances, but it has been accepted for the  ~15 years I have been in the Church. I would tend to discount any admonitions from the Church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the Lord's plan to recover what we have done wrong the Church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure.

Some of >them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations. >Others simply do not address the issues. I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues,  however, a couple of them seem as though they do not require "incredibly  perverse interpretations" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality. "... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers,  nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards,  nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were  some of you..."  I Cor. 6:9-11. Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God?  How does this apply to homosexuals?  I understand "fornication" to be sex outside of marriage.  Is this an accurate definition?  Is there any such thing as same-sex marriage in the Bible?  My understanding has always been that the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife.  I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidence to the contrary. "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion."  Lev. 18:22-23. I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  I know of no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention, intercourse with animals.  Do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a perversion, and if so, why?  That is, what verses would you cite to prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful?  Could the verses you cite be refuted by interpreting them differently?  Can one be a Christian zoophile? By the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and sinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions out of an antipathy towards my fellow "people of alternative orientations".  I do believe, however, that one should read the Bible with an attitude of "what is the Bible trying to say" and not "what do I WANT the Bible to say."  I choose not to give in to my "perverted" sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether I like it or not, that such things are sin.  It is frustrating at times, and I have had days where it really got me down, but I don't blame God for this, I blame the sin itself. - Mark [There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that "homosexual" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute.  That doesn't meant that I think all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the evidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things. I think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why is homosexuality wrong?  Because it's fornication.  Why is it fornication?  Because they're not married.  Why aren't they married? Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony.  Why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony?  Because homosexuality is wrong.  In order to break the circle there's got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is wrong. --clh]

What they didn't mention is that IN THE OPEN, it probably wouldn't do TOO MUCH harm to children, although I wouldn't use it in close proximity to infants.  On the other hand, IN CONFINED spaces, the effects are GREATLY intensified, to the point of LETHALITY, since a sufficient quantity of CS will displace OXYGEN.  When running a CS chamber CAREFUL attention is paid to ventilation.  I wonder if they checked to see if any of the BDs were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory diseases.

But in case there are some misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data file on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longer a luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do have at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is no place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide his or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan. 	Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only car manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and I believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still quite expensive. 	Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics and bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed. --  T. H. Brian Chung          | Happiness is...        | This .sig was brought CESR10::THC                | Ithaca, NY 14850       |

At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared to the slab sides on the Consulier.  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12 (thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).  Also Ettore Bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the development.  So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in today's world.

After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as >well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions. 	My god, a sane person!  Somebody asking intelligent questions rather than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to Nazi Germany.  I question, along with others, the initial raid by the ATF. There are some definite questions needing answers. >1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at >some time before the Feb. 28th raid? 	Probably.  Which is why there are so many people angry at the initial confrontation.  Why attack a compound with as many people in that compound who are willing to die for their leader?  Further, they attacked in the daylight hours without proper backup, medical support, etc.  That was rather stupid... >2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome. 	This I doubt.  While I question the ATF's initial raid, I believe that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single exception of the psychological "warfare" by blaring music, etc.  I think that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome. >3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action? 	See above... >And a few other questions.  Like I said, I believe the actions taken, in >general, were proper.  But I still have some reservations. 	Agreed. >One other point, I'm no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the >"balls" to go ahead and take full responsibility.

 I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem.  Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight  fluid.  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  Some of the  cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend  changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving  conditions.  I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and  had to replace the transmission bearings!). My older cars used 85 weight  oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).

The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already, but there are a number of items not seen here yet..... Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign, based on information provided by NASA headquarters. The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held. The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:  Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called "Bus-1 spacecraft," the orbiter and Spacelab. The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase. Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S. Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.  Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option, from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data Management System. Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kW of power. Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the U.S. lab. Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return. Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and propulsion systems. The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete the Permanent Human Capability with International stage. Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said.  Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C, the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after ET separation. The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 "decks" connected by a centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements.  This "can" would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial attitude. In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3. Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA.  Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the Soyuz TM spacecraft. The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will be available to the SRT through May 5. Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various management options have been developed including:  Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of command.  Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate Administrator.  Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office.  Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program.  Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined. The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible. As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations. What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday and Tuesday at which point the design will be "frozen" to begin the detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to be held May 3. Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated. Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being carried on the schedule are: April 26 Design Freeze on Options for Costing April 27 Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT May 3 Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee May 15 Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee June 7 Final report to Redesign Advisory Committee (Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)

"They're real and they're spectacular", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in consecutive playoff games.  If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game. "Not that there's anything wrong with that." Curtis Joseph has been the "master of his own domain", and the Hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of "chuckers". Not even "Superman" could play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his "cereal." "It's like a sauna in here" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the Arena. It was "very refreshing" to see the Blues "double-dip" the Hawks. The Hawks goons tried to "pick" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues checking line "nipped" those Hawks real well. The fat "Yoyoma" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the "beach". The Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long "journey from Milan to Minsk" Enjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple.

I have enrolled in "The History of Christianity" at a college here in St. Louis. The teacher of the class is what I consider to be closed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of Christianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian. While his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted (or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable student-teacher relationship. So, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the previous discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange of flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major flames. Regards, -- Larry Autry Silicon Graphics, St. Louis [Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the  broadest, commonly used definitions are:   a historical definition   people who accept Christ as Lord and savior   a broad doctrinal definition   narrow doctrinal definitions 1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use.  This would include any group that developed out of the Christian church, and continues within the same broad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group developed from Christianity, and people from very different backgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of Christianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's relevant in some political and ethnic contexts. 2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many Christian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and Presbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that someone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based on technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the modern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and "oneness Pentecostals".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls into this category would accept the Apostle's Creed. 3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition, which includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes groups that are felt to be outside "historic Christianity."  This is of course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that Protestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the Nicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to characterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree are key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A Mormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance. 4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited to a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only consider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style conversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit it to their specific church. I think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used. A lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If you're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll probably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e. to say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use a definition like 3 or even 4. --clh]

This goes along with our belief that if a person is >to marry at all it must be done on this earth... [deletions] The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus' words seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection. This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other- wise, why would Jesus offer "but are like the angels in heaven" as a contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in marriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall, and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least, that's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of  marriages performed on earth.  Your mileage may vary. :) - Mark
> As for the atheists/agnostics who read this list: if you aren't > christian and if you have no intention of ever becoming one why on > earth do you waste your time and mine by participating on a christian > discussion list ? I don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and  muslims are free to so so in other groups as well. It's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning  postings. The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups is the evangelistical method of telling that 'I am right, and you are wrong'. This is true of both theists and atheists. Hopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups  would help concerning assumptions and colorization of views. Cheers, Kent ---

> > >There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask: > >1)  If we encounter a life form during our space exploration, how do we >determine if we should capture it, imprison it, and then discect it? >    Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few years ago.  The question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in Washington, D.C., what was the proper organization to deal with it: The State Department (alien ambassadors), the Defense Department (alien invaders), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens), the Department of the Interior (new non-human species), etc.  It was very much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything intrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a person.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall. >2)  If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will >we expend resources from earth to help them? >    I think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.  The human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the culture.  This may not always be wrong, but that's the way to bet. >3)  With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable, >what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought >back, or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere? > >--  >Have a day, > >   ( )     bobo Doug Loss

WHen a particularly bright burst occurs, There are a couple of other detectors that catch it going off.  Pioneer 10 or 11 is the one I'm getting at here.  This puppy is far enough away, that if a bright burst happens nearby, the huge annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given by BATSE, and we can get a moderately accurate position. Say oh, 2 or 3 degrees. That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it.           Actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talking the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites.  THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 200 pounds of eq.  Well, a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it, and 1 alone weighs about 200 pounds itself.         We decided against it.                                                         -jeremy
Greeting I am starting work on a project where I am trying to make strain gages bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months.  I am currently using hydroxyapaptite back gages, and I have tried M-bonding the gages to the bone.  Apart from those two application methods there doesn't seem to be much else in the literature.  I have only an engineering  background not medical or biological.  I would be interest in any ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone. Thanks for oyur help in Advance.

Quebec dominated Habs for first 2 periods and only Roy kept this one from being rout, although he did blow 2nd goal. Canadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump & pull back most of the time. Hextall made some good saves but really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3 & could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd. Canadians are dead meat, they may take one or 2 but this one is over. Tee it up Jacques, next time you might rest players & forget about 1st place, welcome to the Adams division.     Dennis

Alan> 2.  We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing: "Marvel Alan> not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again" (John 3:7). Alan> Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks to Nicodemus -- a Alan> ruler of the Jews (not a child). Yes, but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement in the same conversation: "Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit." (John 3:6) Clearly infants are not born of the spirit.  Thus, without baptism they are unspiritual.  They are not born with the image of God, but in Adam's fallen image (cf. Gen 5:3).  They have no righteousness of their own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own.  There is only the imputed righteousness of Christ, which believers receive through faith. Alan> 3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the Alan> concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies Alan> weren't free from sin? Your point is a little obscure here, but I think you are saying that Christ used the "innocence" of newborn babes as a metaphor for spiritual re-birth.  But this is not what he did. If you look at the text, he did not speak of spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  We are born of the Spirit once, not twice or several times. We are also born of the flesh once.  The Lord makes it clear that these are separate and different events. It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual birth as re-birth because it is a second birth (for example, Titus 3:5).  But it is not a second *spiritual* birth. The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth, which is used as a symbol of `new life' -- not of innocence.  When an infant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither innocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is baptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a new life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians 2:5).  Then the believer has God's assurance of the forgiveness of their sins, and of Christ's imputed righteousness.

Subject: '88 Corolla 5spd. Hi there, maybe you can help me... I have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.  The gearbox seems excessivly clunky.  I used to have an '85 Corolla, and it was also  somewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as bad as this car!  Is there fluid in the 5speed case?  If there is, could it just be low, or in need of a change?  As I recall, only the autos have fluid. Or am I just mistaken?  Please no flames for owning an import.  I also have an old Dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days... Thanks, Derek

I can't remember how many times during the Penguins-Devils game they showed some guy (without the puck) being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal.  In fact, I think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner. Now the last time I watched a football game, they didn't show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown . . . .  Is it just me??	 Greg
It's about time the boys got it together!! They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games. But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretch in the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please don't flame this statement 'cos you know it's true!  I have to admit that  goaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to a minimum, something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked like he had stopped moping (first star!), although I still don't know why he was so flat in games 1 and 2. If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance,  but a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).

   "Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently,     ....  My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity.    I would think not.    Hate begets more hate, never love. ....    In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our     neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he     commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. ....    - Scott I too dislike the phrase "Hate the sin, love the sinner".  Maybe the definite article is also part of the problem, since it seems to give us license to fixate on our brother's peculiar pecadillo which we have managed to escape by a common grace of heredity, economic situation, or culture.  Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot. That said, I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side of this coin, namely the love of righteousness.  In the Beatitudes, Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness.  In the New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one should always actively desire and work for the cause of good.  In that sense, it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its victims, even when these are its accomplices as well. Maybe "mourn sin, love sinners" catches the idea slightly better than "hate", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passive powerless position.  A balanced Christian response needs grief, love, and carefully measured, constructive anger.  Jesus has all three.  The European pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was devoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love or grief they exemplified. My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian.  A few years back, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died of AIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, and abandoned by most of his surviving friends.  Only my sister and brother-in-law were there with him at the very end.  In her grief over Jack's death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callous bureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack's family, the inertia in Christians' response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jack's own lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life.  Jack himself shared that last anger.  Brought up with strong Christian values, he was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before his AIDS appeared.  (I imply no moral judgement here about Jack's innate sexual orientation, n.b.) Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive. Van Kelly

	What we call today the "Old Testament" was being written up to approx- imately 168 BCE, according to most modern scholars.  Aside from the book of Daniel, the whole OT predates Alexander (the Great).  These books were written (predominantly) in Hebrew. 	There were also other books being written at about this time and later by Greek-speaking, or "Hellenistic", Jews.  These books are those which are reckoned by many denominations as "Apocrypha". 	Before the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is today called the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day.  However, there were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased. This faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day.  They also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine teachings from God. 	By the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.  Christians had come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in synagogues and used for worship.  Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders got together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach) onward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.  In particular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) were not inspired. 	At about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon in somewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia.  A few books (Ecclesi- astes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were those which had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of Ben Sira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian and Hellenistic writings. 	Jerome excluded the 'apocrypha' because they were not in use by Jews of his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in his time.  His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writings was not based on 'inspiration'. 	There is plenty more to say, but I do not have time. 	The passage you quote concerns the book (Rev.) in which it is found. 						Frank D.

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical, biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,  bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.  CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe it is a continuum. I don't know. ================================= Howard Doyle

In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th commandments and in the midst of this listing is "homosexuals."  The decalogue, above everything else, is seen as God's absolute.  If you don't believe in absolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul reveals to be the Messiah of the NT. "Lord Christ Jesus" transliterates to read "Jehovah's Anointed Savior."     In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan gentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards) is not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew full well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for application in the NT.  As I've said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away with. >>of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality >>only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was >>wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act >>"straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying >>to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian >>ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the >>relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's >>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make >>judgements on these questions. This understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being posted.  Please refer to it. > >One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument >is because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  We can do better than "probably" which is not an adequate defense against the statement that Paul's culture didn't have the same understanding of homosexuality as ours.   Again read the article because it uses facts. >>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is >>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one. > >I don't see how you come to that conclusion. I think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of working with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application of the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend, yet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is no remorse, then I feel that Paul's "pastoral" care, as presented in the Corinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion should be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer, then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn't hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays the present "political correctness" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at the present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is politically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how the morals decay.   I guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of economics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own states, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax incentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of relativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment. --Rex [You might want to look over 1 Tim 1:10 again.  If this is really the 5th through 9th commandments, we seem to be missing thieves, and homosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery.  This is of course possible if "arsenokoitia" has a narrower meaning than homosexuality in general, but I think that's not your thesis.  I have no objection per se to the idea that the author of 1 Tim might have quoted the 10 commandments, but 5 through 9, minus one and plus a few things, begins to look a bit marginal.  --clh]

Rex, there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree Masons in this country, and thousands of 33rds. If nasty stuff was really going on, don't you think you'd have more than a couple of disgruntled members "exposing" it? Heck, if what you say is true, then Rev. Norman Vincent Peale is an Osiris worshiper.   [... Long quote from someone named Hislop (source not given) deleted. I'm attempting to extract from it the relevent points:    * Osiris is actually Nimrod, a Babylonian Deity.    * "It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally     founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or     wife of Osiris."   * The Babylonian Nimrod and Osiris are both connected with the building     trade, ie, with Masonry.   * Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro. [isn't this refering to a      Biblical Nimrod, rather than the Babylonian god?]   *  ...there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that 'Osiris      was black'. ...]      There is a long tradition in Masonry of claiming ancient lineage for the order, on the flimsiest of grounds. This dates right back to the Constitutions of 1738, which cite Adam as the first Mason. I've seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians, and Atlanteans. I even have a book which claims to prove that Stonehenge was originally a Masonic temple.      Claims prove nothing. Where's the beef, Rex? [...Claims ex-Mason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge] > Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard.    I'd have to check this. The tomb paintings I remember don't show this. >  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or should I say > hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the "spotted cow".    Can you give ancient citations for this? The druids were suppressed over 2000 years ago. What's your point?    This whole "leopard skin" business sounds bizarre.  I have not yet gone through the Scottish Rite (which contains all of those "higher degrees" anti-Masons get so excited about, and which was invented in the 1750's), but I know enough people who have (and who are good Christians), that I reject your claim. >I'll stand by my statements.

It's not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, I think: something about "amare errantem, interficere errorem", which sounds more like "love the errant, slay the error".  No doubt someone else  will know in particular who minted the phrase.

If we followed the "redistiribution of wealth" (and by the way, ist that what Clinto and the Democrats are trying to do...), EVERYONE would starve in short order.  Not only is it impossoble to organize a fair distribution that depends on every (wo)man's altruism (can you say black market under communisim anyone?), but the current methods of resource production are entirely energy dependant.  There are not enough sources of cheap capital (aside from human capital) to allow us to stop looking at space a an excellent source of materials and realestate.

Perhaps we should boycott those games?  If DC-X and company get finished, and there is a market for it, those "abominable" space will probably be much more cost effective for the companies, and those starving children.  More people buy products, the company hires more workers, end result fewer children die of starvation. --  ---------=======================================================--------- Student Konsultant Making the world safe for computing!

Yeah, it seems toyota has always had a problem with those 2.2's and sound. I know the celicas with em were pretty noisey, and the MR2s were no exception. Now, about large displacement 4s with bad noise.. I have a 90 Grand Am H.O. quad 4, and it sounds really good, almost like a larger 6..

I know that there is a relationship between Fibromyalgia and deep  sleep.  I believe that there are five levels of sleep.

Which level of sleep is thought to be deficient in people with  Fibromyalgia?  Are there any known sleep disturbances associated  with CFS?  What sleep disturbances (if any) are associated with  clinical depression?  Do antidepressants correct the sleep  disturbances in these diseases?

speaking of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin: >It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the >tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. Yes.  For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers, consider:     You alone and your Mother         are more beautiful than any others;     For there is no blemish in you,         nor any stains upon your Mother.     Who of my children         can compare in beauty to these?                 -- St. Ephrem the Syrian, Nisibene Hymns, 27:8, around                    A.D. 370     Lift me up not from Sara but from Mary, a Virgin not only undefiled      but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate, free of every stain of sin.                 -- St. Ambrose, "Commentary on Psalm 118", 22:30, ca. A.D. 388 There are many others. >As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was >more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin >for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) No.  We have, for instance:     Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of     Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, "the Virgin"?     ... And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman     remains undefiled.                 -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, "Panacea against all heresies",                    between A.D. 374-377.     We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine     about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen     to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent     as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal     King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is     merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.                 -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of                     Thessalonica, A.D. 392 Note that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I don't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quite sure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated long before Augustine's time.  We hold that it originated with the  Apostles. Strictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independent of her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately  Conceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin and not been Immaculately Conceived. >Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with >a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition >because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science >discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that >Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception. No.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original sin was transmitted at conception, when a person's life begins. Biology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the truth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could have achieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate Conception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine, but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones. The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was given by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21). >Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  >refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  >would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed >to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine. No.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not based on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation, which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle. Second, the "case for the doctrine" was irreformably sealed in 1854  with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull "Ineffabilis Deus" by Pope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as a dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be believed by the faithful. The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never claimed that, nor shall she. In Christ's Peace, Brad Kaiser 	  Those who trust in Him shall understand truth, 	  and the faithful shall abide with Him in love; 	  Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones, 	  and His care is with His elect. 		    -- Wis 3:9 [NAB]

I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually, I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs.

	         Hello,         Just one quick question:         My father has had a back problem for a long time and doctors         have diagnosed an operation is needed. Since he lives down in         Mexico, he wants to know if there is a hospital anywhere in         the United States particulary famous for this kind of surgery,         kind of like Houston has a reputation for excellent doctors         in eye surgery. Any additional info or pointers will be         appreciated a whole lot!...                 Thanks in Advance.                         Gary Sheutter.                         AT&T Bell Labs.
>Okay, the earth has a magnetic field (unless someone missed something?) > >Okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty.. No, if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field, it produces a voltage. The two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or move the conductor.  The slow shifting of the Earth's magnetic field isn't really significant, especially when you consider how weak the Earth's magnetic field is to begin with. >Now the question.

Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course, this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction. And seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps).  And the physiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our blood, among other things).  In other words, forget it. >Can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the electrical >field? > >After all the dragless satellite is (I might be wrong), a suspended between to >pilons, the the pilons compensate for drag..

[continuing with Dr. DeYoung's article-]                  SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI D.S. Bailey      D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi ("effeminate"), those who engage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing of "inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term's reference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as "homosexuals."  Bailey wants to distinguish between "the homosexual *condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*" [italics in source].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation "sodomites" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39).  Bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers. J. Boswell      The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive sense.       In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites "linguistic evidence and common sense" to support his conclusion that the word means "male sexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes."  His argument is that the arseno- part of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male sexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most interpret the composite term as active, meaning "those who sleep with, make their bed with, men."  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes ("child learner"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such as paidoporos ("through which a child passes"), the paido- is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More directly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it objectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective (343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.      Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti.  These were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive would be parakoitai ("one who lies beside"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that arsenokoitai was the "most explicit word available to Paul for a male prostitute," since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos ("fornicator") and porneuon ("one committing fornication"), found also in the LXX, had been adopted "to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed fornication."*7      In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus, Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai "did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of Paul" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus Empiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in "all discussions of homosexual relation" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including the Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria, Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his omission as "final proof" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11       Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from discussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are Tertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses "circumlocutions."  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius Felix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife (353).      Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes,     There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted    homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every reason    to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of    Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353). It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not disapprove of "gay inclination,"  "gay relationships,"  "enduring love between persons of the same gender," or "same-sex eroticism"  (112, 166-17). ________________________________________________________ 4.

Several tranlation of I Tim 1:10 are:  KJV, "them that defile themselves with mankind";  ASV,  "Abusers of themselves with men";  NASB,  "homosexuals"; RSV, NKJV, NRSV, "sodomites";  NEB, NIV, "perverts"; GNB, "sexual perverts"; In I COr 6:9 these occur:  KJV, "abusers of themselves with mankind"; ASV, "Abusers of themselves with men";  NASB, RSV, "homosexuals"; NKJV, "sodomites";  NEB, "homosexual persversion."  The RSV and NEB derive their translation from two Greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai which GBN has as "homosexual perverts."  NRSV has the two words as "male prostitutes" in the text, and "sodomites" in the footnote.  The active idea predominates among the commentators as well;  it is the primary assumption. 7.  Boswell, Christianity 344.  Yet this was no a word "available to Paul for a male prostitute," for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to Paul (as a serach in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae using IBYCUC confirms).  If Paul coined the term, it would have no prior history, and all such discussion about its lack of usage in contemporary non-Christian and Christian literature is meaningless. 8.  Again this would be expected if Paul coined the word. 9.  The key phrase here apparently is "discussoin," for Boswell admits later (350 n.42) that it occurs in quotes of Paul but there is no discussion in the context.  Hence the implication is that we cannot tell what these writer (Polycarp "To the Philippian 5:3"; Theophilus "Ad Autolycum 1.2, 2.14";Nilus "Epistularum libri quattuor 2.282";  Cyril of Alexandria "Homiliae diversae 14"; "Sybilline Oravle 2.13") meant.  Yet Polycarp, who was a disiple of Hohn the Apostle and died about A.D. 155, argues in the context that young men should be pure.  He uses only the three terms pornoi, malakoi, and arsenokoitai from Paul's list.  This at least makes Boswell's use of "all" subjective.  Apparently Clement of Alexandria "Paedogogus 3.11"; Sromata 3.18"; also belong here. 10..  Yet Eusebius uses it in "Demonstraionis evangelicae 1." 11.  Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostom's use of arsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1, or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when Chrysostom uses it.  Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our study, whether in the lists or other discussions.  Boswell later admits (351) that Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on I Cor.  Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange, it may be that Paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.   12.  Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here, since he renders arsenokoitai as "masculorum concubitores," corresponding "almost exactly to the Greek" (348 n.36). footnotes: _______________________  5.

So your above arguement is really worthless.  The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without  Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick.  Like I said, Mario deserves it, IMHO. But it is a very close race and a  Gilmour victory would not surprise me.

Well, here goes. The first item of business is to establish the importance space life sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared to football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education. All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world.  The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space. I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to  succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld (i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering, chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight. So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs. In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies. This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet, and any other source! I'm eager to hear your comments and see posts on this thread.

But   now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall   go to him, but he will not return to me.'" Anyhow, many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven (where David will someday go). I don't claim to know for sure if this applies to all babies or not. But even if it's just this one, what would you say to this? -jeff adams-
I am writing this to find out the following: 1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis. 2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery. 3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer. My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with  reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he  saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta,  Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.   These treatments were not effective and because the damage was  worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told  there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen  wrap and a "Hill Repair".  He opted for the "Hill Repair". He recovered  very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse  and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva). The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him  that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition  which he called "Barrett's Syndrome". If he can't avoid having reflux will  he necessarily get cancer? Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd  appreciate it. Thanks,
The European version is called 200 SX and have a 1.8 liter engine with turbo and have more power than the US version ( 169 HP ); it goes from 0 to 100 Km/h in 7.5 sec and have a top speed of 225 Km/h ( 140 miles/h ). I just purchased one ( new ) and I am looking for a repair book. I could not find one in FRANCE and GERMANY; does anybody knows where to find one ? Is there one in the UK ? Probabaly no use to look in the US as the 240 SX have here a different motor. I am very pleased with the car and have no problem with it; but like to have good technical documentation about the car I own.                                Regards

Hathaway  The problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  When the mission was planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there was enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  THey have now planned for 5 EVA's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve EVA's and an emergency EVA.  Obviously that is coming from somewhere. My guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.    I just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper better,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable space manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost. it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck. pat

I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  Before I delve into its innards, I thought I'd check "net.wisdom" on the subject. :) It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know) 2.0l EFI 4-banger auto 35k miles When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of getting "stuck" in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop for a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to "reset" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when put in drive.   My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves). My background is that my father owns a service station and I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please feel free to be as technical as you want. :) I'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free beer. <grin> Skoal, Chris

Perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the Mexican variant you bring up. That is, many (not all) extreme fundamentalist Christians use the excuse of teaching their children Biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment. I do not see many Mexicans using their Mexican heritage as an excuse for abuse. It is indeed this judgemental, controlling legalism of many fundamentalist Christians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true to the Gospel of Christ, the gospel of love. I have seen this sort of thing too often, even amoung my own relatives, to believe there is no relationship.  Judgementalism often leads to overly strict, and thus abusive, discipline of children.

There's been rumors he was officially released right at the end of the season when his contract expired, but I haven't seen confirmation. It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he wasn't going to make it for a while, and the Sharks would have to sign him to a contract, which given his problems competing at the IHL level this spring, doesn't make sense.  --

>On the other hand, I'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes >Fereirra made.  Imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of >hindsight. Well, the "jettison for youth fast" strategy was his. Also in hindsight, it didn't work all that well, but I think it was more because it left the Sharks on a tightrope without a net, not that it was inherently flawed. It was the injuries that caused us to fall. >Let's say that in the view of the Sharks' upper management, the attempt >to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra. From all indications, it wasn't the "major" factor, but the "last straw". There were personality conflicts among Shark management, and disagreements over how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded vs. kept, but who was being sent to KC. What Ferriera did, if rumors are right, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed). >I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept >him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey! I think if they'd kept Ferriera, they would have lost some of their other management staff. Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost Grillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep those three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now a moot point).  The Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly consensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There were conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or accomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics.  I think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as a "Shark person". I hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in Anaheim, too, because it'll be good for hockey. (but I want the Ducks to be doormats for a couple of years, so the Sharks succeeed first). --

One of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players to be shown between plays. The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile, other times you get burned.
Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos?

All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad, but at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing before he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything he wants to him. His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach until he found an opening -- and I never once saw him find an opening worth talking about. He got neutralized quickly, and stomped on a couple of times. Unless he shows some new tricks in camp, he'll be on my "career minor leaguer" list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL, I expect the Sharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He needs to get stronger, he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some versatility as something else than a simply goond, because he wasn't particularly good as a goon. --

My screams intensify as I finally emerge from under the car, and I struggle to my feet in front of the car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant. Then the engine seizes, but not before the cylinder head explodes, piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron. This happens every time. I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic $25 instead paying the hospital $250,000 and the dealer $25,000 for a new car. This gets costly when you change the oil every 3000 miles. - Toadface

The way I see it (and please, astromomers give me a swift net-kick in the butt if i'm out of the ball park), the astromers are making the best of limited possiblities, there's only one hubble, and the shuttle makes another in the near future a non-thought.  Perhaps those self same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind mounted on the reverse sides of the mirror's (if that is what is used) and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope... --  ---------=======================================================--------- Student Konsultant Making the world safe for computing!

>Does the "Thermoscan" instrument really work?  It is supposed to give you a >fast and accurate temperature reading in the ear.  How far in the ear does >one have to insert the instrument?  Is it worth the $100 it is currently >selling for? No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.   The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum. The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then pushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong. It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on  yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees, and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.   I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this, and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office. I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect that many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason. In short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe it doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.

QUESTION: what's your experience with car wash wax? This is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in water, sponge it on you car, hose it off, and dry it with cloth. Many people have used it. It is very easy to work with and gives seeminly the same visual results as that of paste type of wax. But, does it last long? Does it have any negative effects to car paint? Can you forward your reply directly to my email id? Thanks. James

We found an 8 ft. deep cistern that we lined with some 10 ft. 2X6s.  We put a large can (one of those industrial sized pork'n beans cans) stuffed with oily rags and scraps of wood in the bottom.  After lighting the fire, we LOWERED a box of .38 Spc. SWCs into the can.  We heard pops, one solid bang and several "fizzzz shussss".  After we thought the excitment was over, we boldly climbed down to find that NONE of the bullets had left the can, several of the shells were lieing around the bottom of the well and the boards had all died of smoke inhalation.  And 5 or 6 of the shells still had live primers! -- Dillon Pyron                      | The opinions expressed are those of the TI/DSEG Lewisville VAX Support    | sender unless otherwise stated.

What was once a fair agreement that shared the wealth is now >Northlands sucking the blood out of the Oilers franchise. The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is that a deal is a deal.  Sather has spouted this repeatedly.  Pocklinton has a contract with Northlands until 1999.  A deal is a deal.  Perhaps if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players such as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with his revenues he wouldn't be losing money.  He has admitted pulling this money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses.  >The Oilers have paid several times over what the Coliseum cost to >build, and bring Edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the >world that is essentially priceless...to nickel-and-dime the Oilers >just so Northlands can use revenue sucked out of the Oilers to  >subsidize their horse-racing operations is insanity. I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization.   I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but  he is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has "sucked" revenue out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests. Pocklington is not to be trusted.  I doubt very much that any Oiler team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship. As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or draft picks. --                                             "So many morons... rm                                                 ...and so little time." 
  (stuff deleted)     [First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.] So what you're saying then, is that God exercises direct control, or influence upon humanity. He doesn't control our every thought or action, but takes what we do, whether it be intended for evil or not, and turns it into something good. It seems to me, that this idea conflicts with the belief that God gave humans FREE WILL. As far as I can determine, it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas. If God were to exert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime, he would be  impeding upon someone's free will. Unless, of course, you believe that God did not give us complete and unabated free will, but rather, some sort of conditional free will. Something that allows us to make our own choices and control our own lives except when God wants to use us to fulfill some good purpose of his own by "hardening our heart" or controlling us in some other way. I hear alot of people who look at various events, mostly  catastrophies or things like the AIDS epidemic and make comments about God's will. I have a very difficult time understanding why people believe that God controls anything that happens on this planet. Except, possibly when being asked to through someone's prayer. According to the Bible, Pharoah was going to let Moses' people go after one or two plagues, but God kept hardening his heart so Moses could cast all 7 plagues upon the Egyptians, the last plague causing the death of many innocent children. So then, God impeded upon Pharoah's free will and used him as a puppet. God did this not just to free the Hebrews, but to free them in some sort of a grand fashion. I suppose from the Hebrew's point of view, this could be seen as turning something bad into good, but I'm sure the Egyptians didn't see it this way. All of your examples of how God turned something bad into something good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over another. After all, it's only good based upon your point of view. Why does God, who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity, play favorites?

Having everyone on Earth subject to some ad agency's "poor taste" *is* an abomination. (abomination : n. loathing; odious or degrading habit or act; an object of disgust.

There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological  (esp. neurological) conditions induced by playing video games (e.g. Nintendo). Apparently, there have been reported several cases of "photosensitive epilepsy", due to the flashing of some patterns and the strong attention of the (young) players. One poster to comp.risks reported some action from the British Government. A quick search in a database reported the following two published references: 1. E.J. Hart, Nintendo epilepsy, in New England J. of Med., 322(20), 1473 2. TK Daneshmend et al., Dark Warrior epilepsy, BMJ 1982; 284:1751-2. I would appreciate if someone could post (or e-mail)  any reference to (preferably published) further work on the subject. Any pointer to other information and/or to possible technical tools  (if any) for reducing the risks are appreciated. Many thanks, Antonella D'Alessandro, Pisa -- Italy.

>I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a >lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? >In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously >you aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive >to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies. > Well I am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes control their dreams.  For example, I might decide before going to sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a specific place.  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often (not always) redirect events to something more pleasant. I guess I think that the same standards apply in these "directed" dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing adultary). When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose to dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my "inner life" - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  In either case, the cause needs to be resolved.   In fact, either case is pretty rare.  I don't often remember dreams that I don't chose to have.  When I do, they almost always tell me something important. I also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour (in fact I've had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can remember, and it was definately spiritually important) I tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and white. Interesting topic - I'll be fascinated to read other responses. Alison PS. Just to make it clear, I don't do ( and have never tried ) OOBEs.     I tend to think they are off limits for Christians.
: I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and : demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs were : definitely involved.  : My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the : hospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate : medications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling : us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if : he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With : the help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication : discontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug. : Two days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many : medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions. I saw the same thing happen to my father, and I can more or less validate your take on hospitals.  It seems to me that medical science understands precious little about taking care of the human machine.  Drugs are given as a response to symptoms (and I guess that makes sense since all the studies that  validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow assessment of the degree of particular symptoms).  But there seems to be very little appreciation for the well-being of a person outside of the numbers that appear on a test.  I watched my dad wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue while in the hospital.  There is something a little crazy about a system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue.  It is really, really bizarre.     -- 
Aside to the moderator: ><see below...> I won't quote any of it, but there are several errors in the article. Not things that are just differences of opinion, but the writer just plain has his facts confused. For example, Kip McKean was *asked* to come to the Lexington church by the leaders there. He brought no team. He actually had been in Charleston, IL up to that point. He had many friends, even leaders in Gainesville, telling him not to go, because people in the Northeast weren't "open" and he'd be wasting his time and talents. Really!! (This fact was a kind of "inside joke" at one point after the church in Boston took off so well... Not open, indeed!) ;-) I could take it on point by point, but I am not in a position to know one way or the other about some things in the article. I just wanted to point out that it contains misinformation. Mark --  Mark Wuest                              |     *MY* opinions, not AT&T's!!

Organization: [via International Space University] About three weeks ago on the SPACE list, someone was quoting a source on the relative traffic and rankings of this listserv.  A figure of 88th in traffic(?) was given.  Unfortunately I did not clip the message and I would like to know the source of the rankings list.  If anybody still has that discussion on their disk or knows the source (or is the poster himself!) I'd appreciate getting that reference.

Fred Gilham asks (May 11) whether it is true that Kurt Goedel wrote a version of the ontological argument for the existence of God. Yes, he did. He did not publish it, but it will be published by the Oxford University Press in German and with English translation in Volume 3, due to appear this fall, of his Collected Works. Meanwhile, you can find a summary, or perhaps the whole thing, in an article by Jordan Howard Sobel called "Goedel's ontological proof" in the book ON BEING AND SAYING, edited by Judith Jarvis Thompson (sp?), published by the MIT Press in 1987. Professor C Anthony Anderson of the Philosophy Department of the University of Minnesota has written an article, "Some Emendations of Goedel's Ontological Proof," which appeared in the magazine FAITH AND PHILOSOPHY, v. 7 (1990): 291-303. It discusses some objections that various critics have raised against Goedel's proof, and offers a revised version of the proof that is not vulnerable to these objections.  Yours,  James Kiefer
1993-1994 NHL Hockey Pool By Denis Papp and Chris Stoochnoff   Rules:   - Pick 17 players (3 LW, 3 C, 3 RW, 3 LD, 3 RD, 2 Goalies)   You may pick ANY 17 players from any team.   - Points for players are as follows:         - 1 point per goal         - 1 point per assist         - 1 point per 10 PIM   - Points for goalies are as follows:         - 2 points per win         - 1 point per tie         - 1 point per assist         - 1 point per 5 PIM         - 2 points per shutout         - 100 points per goal   Entries:   -Entries can be sent (by mail or ascii text file) to Chris Stoochnoff or Denis Papp on Hard Wired BBS (434-7996).  -Due date for entries is the first day of regular season play. After that, no more entries will be accepted (unless it is just slightly late. If that is the case, there will be a small penalty applied to the team).   Prizes:   Prizes have not yet been considered. They could range from nothing to free time on Hard Wired BBS or even something else (if you have any suggestions... please feel free to put your two cents worth in).  One idea is to get whoever is willing to to submit an equal amount of money, and that will go to be the prize money.  The prize money will go to the top team who has submitted to the prize pool.  A list of all people who submit money will be posted, as well as those who didnt - if it is done this way.  Cost:   The cost... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! There is absolutely no fee for this pool.   Note:   -If you have any questions, please feel free to send them to Denis Papp or myself (Chris Stoochnoff). The players positions (ie. Brett Hull is Right Wing) will be decided by the year book I will be using. So, if you do not know a certain players position, or you are not completely sure what position he plays, then ask me and I'll tell you.   -And for a great time, call the Hard Wired BBS at (403)-434-7996 (this will be the location where the pool standings will be displayed).   Internet Users:   will be distributed by email as well.

Also, VW uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps reduce particulates as well, although I don't know the mechanics of it. Many diesel cars,busses, and trucks in Europe are now being equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up diesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway. It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even further ahead of gas engines in emissions. erik
We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform.  This will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. We want to build it from "off the shelf" technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue Satellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions: 1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian? 2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies? 3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous orbit? 4.  Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders? Please post replies here or send E-mail to me at: Thanak you very much for any assistance you can provide. 			-mike fennell

When I was a school boy, my biology teacher told us of an incident in which a couple were very passionate without actually having sexual intercourse.  Somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation. Was my biology teacher misinforming us, or do such incidents actually occur? Stephen

Well, partly because I, as an ardent fan of both sports, would rather see Game 3 of the NHL playoffs than Game 3 of 162 of the MLB season (even if the bb game involves the Red Sox).	 ESPN may have had contractual obligations. I understand that part. But it's a bit inaccurate to call us "selfish" just because we want to watch the watch the game we love. Am I, as a baseball fan, "selfish" when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month? I don't think so. While, ESPN may have contractual obligations, we, as their consumers, have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us. There's certainly nothing wrong with that.     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++     + AHL, ECAC and Boston Bruins contact for rec.sport.hockey		   +     + Adirondack Red Wings, Calder Cup Champs: '81  '86  '89  '92	   +     + Clarkson Hockey, ECAC Tournament Champs: '66  '91  '93		   +     + Glens Falls High Hockey, NY Division II State Champs: '90  '91       +     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Because of the 'questionable' bids being placed for the set-up, I am including some 'guideline' prices in this REPOST. Negotiable, of course. In anticipation of the arrival of my new computer system, I am selling my CDTV and accessories.  I am in no rush to sell this so if you don't have the money now, but may be able to get it in a few weeks, make a bid and let me know.

Quinn has improved the >team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender. >When Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a >contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup >contender. The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively, embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the  playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the Norris). It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before  Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*-- tougher division than the Norris, also known as the "Snorris", division. Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such  powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was  everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris. Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade. >So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM. >Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray. There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone reading this will agree.   We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out, like last year). >Gregmeister --Randy
Hi Javier, (how are things at Corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?) Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least, by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure on the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec). There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.
I see a parallel between what I will stupidly call the "homosexual"  issue and the "atheist" issue. Please take no offense at these comparisons. The homosexual "feels" things that I admit I do not "feel".  He learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to his feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences. That is, this model gives him a sense of understanding his situation. Models that do not match up with what he knows he feels will be discarded. However, one wonders if once accepting the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on  the definition he has already accepted, which of course validates his model. If that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel. The Christian "feels" things that an atheist claims he does not feel. The Christian accepts the Christian theology as the true description of what his feelings mean. Once accepting this model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model which of course validates his Christianity. As a reminder, I am a Christian, a Catholic, I don't hate  homosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understand them. I only compare them because they are both so foreign to me. Am I as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems blind to me? Or am I as prejudiced against atheistic denial of religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against  attempts by society to deny his sexuality? Or am I just out to lunch, again?

>This paragraph brought to mind a question.  How do you (Mormons) reconcile >the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection >people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)? Well, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a similar question.  I hope it helps: [Begin repeat of previous post] As for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a  problem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.   Luke's version has Jesus saying that the children of this world  marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies one for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I think the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let's have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable ideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30, Mark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36. What happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to the "Leverite" marriage which required the brother of a man who died without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.   The children would be considered children of the deceased, just as though the woman's first husband had fathered them.  It seems obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be the wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a scene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to father children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite marriage was equal to the first for they ask, "Whose wife shall she be in the resurrection?"  At this point it seems obvious that if she is anybody's wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of which brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was refering to this when he says, "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures or the power of God." (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24, phrase not in Luke's account). Anyway, the Sadducees ask, "Whose wife will she be in the resurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?"  Jesus answer is that, "In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage..." (Mat 22:30) "When they rise from the dead they neither marry..." (Mark 12:25)  "They which are accounted worthy to obtain that world neither marry..." (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to say, "but are as the angels in heaven" or the equivalent.  I find this last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels nor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claim that they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no Biblical support for this.) I think what Jesus is saying here (and it is clearest in Matthew's and Mark's accounts) is that marriages will not be performed in the resurrection.  This goes along with our belief that if a person is to marry at all it must be done on this earth.  However, we do believe that a marriage performed by the authority of God can be binding in eternity.  In fact, the first marriage appears to have been performed by God himself before death entered the world (in the Garden of Eden).  What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. (Mat 19:6)  Jesus also told Peter and the other apostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound in heaven (Mat 16:19, 18:18).  I believe that this also refers to marriages performed by the proper authority.

If we are indeed talking about CS, then this is not quite accurate. CS is "just" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't have direct CNS effects. However, it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968 8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked my breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful, and my entire face felt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after exposure, and I was coughing for days afterwards.  If I was exposed to a dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, I doubt whether I could find the exit. Indeed, I can't imagine living through it. --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~              |      Die Welt ist alles, was Zerfall ist.     | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How much does >a GT-40 go for? How many were made? I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40 registry (as of '88 or so).

The last price I saw estimated on a GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari that it would blow the doors off of ;-). I don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although I'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think,  and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was rear-engine, rear-drive, with the "bundle of snakes" exhaust headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I can't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.

Ron Miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career.   I've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar System Exploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of spaceflight.  For several years he's been working on a *big* project which is almost ready to hit the streets.  A brochure from his publisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enough to type in part of it (it's rather long).  Especially given the Net's strong interest in vaporware spacecraft...                  ==================================                          The Dream Machines: An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature                             By Ron Miller                   with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne, Florida, USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9 This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them.    Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences. This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship. SPECIAL FEATURES Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA archives An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, "Hey,  let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!" -- that's fine. It's entirely another to say, "Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it!"  Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but from what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000 level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse.  I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific.

	On Tuesday, when it was raining in Chicago, ESPN provided  bonus hockey coverage.  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the NY-Wash OT was replaced with the Angels-?? game.

:  : I am considering buying a 1993 Chevy or GMC 4x4 full-size pickup with : the extended cab.  Any opinions about these vehicles?  Have there been : any significant problems? :  : --  : So many newsgroups, so little time! I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet  says that the noise is "a characteristic of the transmission." Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third, the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for "engine longevity" reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does. Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times  so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between stabilizer and control arm fell off). Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for  them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never buy another Chevrolet.

When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here.  That's an entirely  different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman.

The "largest computer networks in the world" phrase is a definition of  the Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.  As for the business of whether or not it is large, it is large compared to say, the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names, at least to this point.  And just for my own curiosity I thought I'd look up the "official" definition of large in the dictionary.  It reads: large - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.             2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size. Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there,  thereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope. >He might be impressed by the size of the list of names. Why would he be impressed with this unless it were "large"?  I am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear yourself speak.   I personally don't know whether or not I agree with the letter.  I have very mixed emotions about it.  I like the names as they are, and don't think they make it that difficult to learn the game, but there might be a shred of validity to the change.   --  Paul W.

I have a good friend whose lifestyle is very sinful.  Do I hate the things she does to herself and others?  Yes.  Do I hate her?  Absolutely not.  In fact, she tells me repeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world.  I care about her very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life. It's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above.  I've felt it with my friend more than once.  There is a very important  part of Christianity that you've overlooked above and makes it possible to "love the sin but hate the sinner."  Before I look at someone else's life and sin, I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see in *me* as I see in others, probably more.  Self-righteousness is contradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you describe happen.  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say, "Wretched man that I am!" [Romans 7:24 (NASB)], that Christian will be able to love the sinner and hate the sin.  If we have the attitude of the Pharisee  who said, "I thank Thee that I am not like other men..." [Luke 18:11 (NASB)], we will hate both.   -- Scott at Brandeis 	"But God demonstrates His     "The Lord bless you, and keep you; 	 own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you, 	 while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you; 	 Christ died for us."	       the Lord lift up His countenance on you, 				       and give you peace." 		-- Romans 5:8 [NASB]		-- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]
It's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them. Without further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4: 1) Servotronic steering: [For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and used in Audis and BMWs.] I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past couple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to report now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I suppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been loaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that I have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much happier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is ruined. The steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and there is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for improvement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the Japanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in "feel" and engineer it out completely. 2) Engine Wheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific punch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2 liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a fashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm redline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s. The technical achievement is breadthtaking. Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In fact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts are almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the "overboost" feature than to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the right foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a few moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go, maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite a heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado VR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding 5 banger.. Yes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as serene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite up to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that in terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However, lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined. The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more musical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical, with a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can match its grunt. The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall.  Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should offer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in extremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically, in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again... 3) Chassis I've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16.. which is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke wheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth watering macho, yet subdued look.  On rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I digress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved out of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough roads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will never worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars. The servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I think a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires, talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a banked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I went around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the limits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were thrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of story.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car. The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too surprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi 100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to brag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on anti-lock capability. 4) Comfort For a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also excellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected gizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this and that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed because Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the car has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance.   Unusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch. Noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't consider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer. 5) Conclusion Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price of $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if it doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is worth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also  top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant  automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating. eliot
I'm new to this group and this may have been discussed already, in which case my apologies, but... I have a '92 Integra with an auto box. According to the manual the car has a lock up torque converter, or something similar. What is it, what does it do and how does it work? (Excuse my ignorance). Does anybody know? --Parms. (no sig yet)
[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3] R. Scroggs      Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a "Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology."  The term is derived from Lev 18"22 & 20:13 where the LXX juxtaposes the two words arsenos ("male") and koiten ("bed"), and represents the Hebrew miskab zabar ("lying with a male").   Yet he believes that Paul did not originate the term, but borrowed it from "circles of Hellenistic Jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid "contact with the usual Greek terminology" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs observes, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to native-speaking Greeks (108).      Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's "learned discussion" (107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of "one who lies with a male" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9), which Scroggs interprets as "the effeminate call-boy," arsenokoitai is the active partner "who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic model of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he affirms (109).      This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The combination of pornoi ("fornicators"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ("slave dealers") refers to "male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave dealers [who procure them]" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of pederasty "which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males" (121).  Even "serious minded pagan authors" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1.  Consequently Paul "Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind" (122). We cannot know what Paul would have said about the "contemporary model of adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships" (122).      In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent.  He concludes that Paul "does not care about any specific item in the lists" (104).       Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a "catalogue of vices,"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are "irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today" (129).  The "model in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the NT" that "Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination. . . " (127).       REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI D. Wright      In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have come under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's view is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out several shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults Boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the "Apostolic Constitutions,"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28).  Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the gender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean "a male who sleeps with a male," making arseno- the object.      Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the term, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it as an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity: "No semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its object and where "the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its gender" (132).       It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources.  For example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis, androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite Hippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the Syriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34).       Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ("adultery"), porneia ("fornication"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris (136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the Ten Commandments as "You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis ("you shall not commit adultery"), ou paidophthoreseis ("you shall not practice homosexuality with boys"), you shall not steal. . ." (150 n. 43).      Another occurrence of arsenokoitein ("commit homosexuality") exists in the Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by Or.Sib., book 2 (137-38).      Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew upon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John the Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.      Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be absent "from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted (140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g. Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing Scripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41).       Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention (141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom, omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom 1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright observes that Boswell has "signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world.       Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim and I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning "homosexual" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of the word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited conclusion based on them.      Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into being under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke "generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).      In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and others who limit the term to "active male prostitutes" or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies.   get into the "good" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will include "Symposium" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of Paul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul's use of Lev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done away with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the general.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our culture, should stick around for this one.] ___________________________ Independently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is made in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from 146BC to AD 1100). 14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul's language in Rom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P. Zaas, "I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP 17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai were part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul's wors at the end of the vice list, "and such were some of you," indicate that "Paul is addressing real or potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by rote" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry (147). 15  On Boswell's treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, "Relations Natural and Unnatural"  A Response to John Boswell's Exegesis of Romans 1," JRE 14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique. 16  D.F. Wright, "Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I Cor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53. 17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, "ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul," effectively refutres Boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai.  He finds the meaning to be general, "a male who has sex with a male" (4-11).   18  Wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers. 19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the references to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B. DeYoung, "A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha," BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53. 20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently "why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia, and why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?"  (152 n. 61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a "remarkable originality" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).

Such nonsense do not belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on this issue. We chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define our own Christianity. we see in parts. If you see something that I do not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on your belief! There is no wonder that your "miracle" does not work. You designet it yourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like the one you describe, I see no reason why your "miracle" should really happen. God is the one who does miracles, not humans! After all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed for the same goal, following different paths. Remember that we are going to spend eternity together. If I can not stand your view here on earth, how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you? Tongues is a question of belief. Not wether you believe in Jesus, but if you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way better than others. > Perhaps I would believe the "gifted ones" more if they were > glorifying God rather than themselves. Then perhaps we'd > witness a real miracle. Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I don't know. But if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are faked. In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He said that "I do nothing, except what my father tells me." Perhaps it woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that example!

Forgive me, but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a physician's posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin B6.  I can't seem to locate the article, but I recall there was mention of some safe limits. I looked at a "Balanced 100" time release formulation from Walgreen's and noted that the 100 mg of B6 was some thousands times the RDA.  Is this safe?!?. Also what was the condition that B6 was theraputic for? Mail would be just fine if you don't want to clog the net. Thanks,

How the hell can you say the guy is a goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality?  Saying that hurting a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine.  New rules and a new  referee system need to be instituted.  Right now, too many of the real goons get away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their  asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the  play.  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an improvement. ********************************************************************************Tim Drozinski "Chew electric death, snarling cur!"

A month ago I made a deal with him over the net.  I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu. I thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.   I sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu. I receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the cpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU. I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or what address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.) He never reply my mail.   I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get throught, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply. I call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had send out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it to.   He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day. To my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he never reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every of my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)       emailing him, but he won't reply my mail. So if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him. he can be reach at: 			Dana Weick 			4238 W Las Palmaritas 			Phoenix, AZ 85051     (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number.

Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge, bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you plug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real sympathetic!    If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed,  DON'T GUESS! ********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:**************************** I call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was  busy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house went by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon- nected.

Just saw a new commercial(?) by the NRA. It starts out with a  bunch of politicians talking about how to get rid of crime. They finally realize that they need to put criminals away longer but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gun law.( During this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on how easy criminals get off )  In the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law  will get rid of crime and there is this grungy looking guy (criminal) watching him on tv just laughing his ass off.

I need information on the medical (including emotional :-) pros and cons of circumcision (at birth).  I am especially interested in references to studies that indicate disadvantages or refute studies that indicate advantages.  A friend who is a medical student is writing a survey paper, and apparently the studies she has run into are all for circumcision, the main argument being a lower risk of penile cancer.

>Quebec dominated Habs for first 2 periods and only Roy kept >this one from being rout, although he did blow 2nd goal. >Canadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump & >pull back most of the time. Do you notice that _nobody_ on the team is willing to take charge? A dominant defenceman would be nice....too bad Schneider got hurt. He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes.  Speaking of Chelios, I  wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade. I also wish we still had Corson. Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the  bench. Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation, apparently.  I have no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with Carbonneau.  Savard is skating well, and is one of the only dangerous Canadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck.  Too bad nobody is in front most of the time. Do you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique gets knocked down?  It's disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5'10", 172) getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3", 205) with no reply from the team, except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit, Denis Savard  threw the best (only?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked Sundin off-balance.  When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer, there's big trouble someplace... >Hextall made some good saves but >really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3 >& could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd. Aside from that second goal, Roy did stand on his head.  The third  period at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the period, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made  the saves (we'll ignore that second goal), so now it's up to the team. -- P.S.  To all those Grant Fuhr doubters.....Buffalo 4, Boston 0.   'nuff said.  And did somebody say Dale Hunter was a playoff choker? I'd rethink that position :-)

>>	That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining >>these weapons,  >This means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough.  Good. 	Very narrow.  Very, very narrow.  If you'll recall, I was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain situations.  How can you possibly define what is a weapon and what isn't is only the start of this. >>and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of >>modern practice five months or five centuries down the road.   >I would hope so.  Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon >whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic >nuclei. 	And you've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors blow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See what a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just north of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the PRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor itself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is flawed in a few respects already. >  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses  >in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause  >death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of >people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or >cropland.   	Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.  If you don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus.  Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits this definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild. >Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous >gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there >is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for >research purposes on such chemicals. 	And I can show where any such gas has other uses.  For example, perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers.  Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can be used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that it can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance. So, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I still have those pesky gophers. >I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for  >definitions. 	The basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good. >>I'll give >>you a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the >>road?  In the USA, that is a weapon of mass destruction,  >Nope.  It is not considered a weapon. 	It is under your proposed law.  So is a silage pit if there is run-off.  So are underground fuel tanks. >>biological in >>nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate >>the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water.  So, >>where do *you* draw the line?  In the USA, the EPA has ruled that >>a pile of scrap iron is illegal.  Care to draw a thinner line this time? >It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are >banned for other reasons. 	It meets all the criterion of a weapon.  It is an instrument that can be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose, and despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass destruction is rather a given. 	It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not see a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some pretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for abuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to, generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law.  Again, ripe for abuse. <  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.  Don't blame them.  > <     USENET: Post to exotic, distant machines.  Meet exciting,      > <                 unusual people.

Being that both of the first  >two games were dominated by Pitt., you would think that they would show a  >different game.

I suspect that NESN was only going to sell one telecast to ESPN (remember, ESPN only owns exclusive rights to the FINALS, not the entire playoffs).  Since ESPN bought the SCA contract, there are less wrangles to untie with showing the Devils and Penguins. > >Also, some of you should know that (as far as I can tell) ESPN is not going  >to show Campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds.

Plus they have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule unless the NHL was willing to make a western club move up their game. I think the NHL got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for ABC. >Also, does anyone have info on ABC coverage for this Sunday (4/25)? > > Same exact coverage as last week:  Pit-NJ game 4 in the east, Chi-StL in the central, LA-Cgy in the mountains and west. > >Robert Andolina >
  Ok, Buffalo fans.  I am a Red Wings fan, but am amazed at how the Sabres are beating up on the Bruins.  Is there any reason for this?  Is it Grant Fuhr or Mogilny and Lafontaine?  I would like to hear from you since I do not know much about the Sabres.

Reports in Ottawa today say that the Senators have come to a verbal agreement with last seasons first pick and 2nd overall choice Alexei Yashin on a 5 year deal. As well the Senators have signed their second round pick Chad Penney who is currently playing for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the Ontario Junior league playoffs.

I'm not sure if this is a big issue, but it seems to me like it might be -- up till now, all >1g forces applied to the mirror and its mounting (and nearly all =1g forces) have been applied along the telescope's optical axis, and against the mirror's base.  Reentry would apply forces along roughly the same axis, but tending to pull the mirror away from the mount, and the landing would apply on-edge forces to both the mirror and mount.  It could be that one or both of these would not survive. greg --  -------------------------------------------------------------- Cray Research, Inc.

>...Over the years we have decided that certain >cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior >to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very >little crime, no homelessnes, no poverty... This is, shall we say, an overly-broad statement.  In particular, are you referring to the native American culture that existed in 1400, or the one that existed in 1800?  (Simplify things by assuming we're talking about the eastern US rather than the whole continent.)  Given that those were *radically* different cultures, which one are you referring to? >...If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in >houses, farm the land and go to church on sunday? Note that the pre-Columbian native Americans, east of the Mississippi, did all of these things.  (Well, maybe not "on Sunday", but they did have organized religions, not to mention cities and governments.)  If you are judging the native Americans by the tribal culture that existed in 1800, you might want to read an account of the De Soto expedition to find out what pre-Columbian native American culture, at least in the more civilized parts of the continent, was like. --

I know this is the wrong place to post this, but I couldn't find any relevant newsgroups in my area. For those of you who are from PA, where is VASCAR (where the cops measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used?  I'm especially interested in the Pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior experiences, if possible).  For those PA and non-PA, if they use VASCAR in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc.  What I'm interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk of being caught.  You can always detect radar, but there's no way to fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are. Thanks a lot,     Arun Jayakumar

I would like to hear from people who are thinking of going to the Urbana 93 conference in December this year.  I have recently received info from IFES (International Fellowship of Evangelical Students) and am thinking about attending although I am still not sure whether I can afford it. I would also like to hear from people involved in IFES or IVF groups just to hear how things are going on your campus. Are there any news groups or groups of people who already do this. I am involved in the Christian Fellowship at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.  If you are interested to find out how we are going  mail me to find out. Matt Reimer

News got a commitment that the post-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within one minute or so of the game  ending. As for the earlier comments about CBC being "Ontariocentric" frankly the no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the West cant  see the Leafs  and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game. The reason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising for six hours of hockey in  one night.  As for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people.

My 	point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing 	this year.

This is not arrogance -- > it is just an inescapable fact. Yes, there are these two senses of interpretation, and certainly our decision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own private opinion.  However, when reading Scripture, we have to remember that the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction, and that the interpretation that matters is the one God intended.  For example, if I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the doctrine of reincarnation, I am wrong because that is not the intended interpretation.  The prophets didn't make up this teaching; it came from God, and we must accept it as such.  This necessarily means that our private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God intended to convey.  Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to determine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make us recognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically accepted as the infallible interpretation of God.  We need to test the spirits to see if they are from God.  When the Holy Spirit speaks, he says the same thing to all; he won't tell me that a passage means one thing and tell you it means another.  If the two of us come to conflicting conclusions, we can't both be completely right.  We know our interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a whole agrees on what Scripture means.  This is how we know the doctrines of the Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, etc. infallibly.  These matters are not up for private interpretation. This is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of the false teachers.  They preferred their own private interpretation to the God-given teaching of the apostles.  It is through such private interpretation that the traditions of men, so soundly denounced in Scripture, are started. Tony
My mother has been advised to have a bone scan performed?  What is this procedure for, and is it painful?  She's been having leg and back pain which her GP said was sciatica.

The above article is a good short summary of traditional Christian teaching concerning the death of Mary.   Walker.  He tells the story very well. I would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate "The Dormition (or falling asleep) of the Theotokos (the mother of God)".  The Icon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles who are weeping.  Christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what seems to be a small child.  This is, in fact, Mary's soul already with Christ in Heaven.  The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us as Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death.  It forshadows the general resurrection on the last day.  The disciples were not surprised to find Mary's body missing from the grave.  She was the Mother of the Savior.  She was the first of all Christians.  She gave birth to the Word of God.  If it were not for her we would not be saved.  This is why we pray in the Orthodox Church, "Through the prayers of the Theotokos, Savior save us." Timothy Richardson

   >I'm sure such weapons have been developed.  Our society does not,    >however, condone their possession or use.   Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article. I'm actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I didn't make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose "the authorities" might have been a better term than "society".  Carry and use a firearm in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect, at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do. And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.    In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or    so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-    abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny,     though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a     lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.      IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or     a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-    grabbers' logic.   Agreed.    You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as     important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious     good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities     about something as big and diverse as US society. My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable weapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload of trouble should you be forced to use them.    Or by the    naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause     to someone who would be a criminal anyway. I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.          Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself    if others' thoughts are not that kindly, That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to  have the means to defend myself when that in not possible. I *think* we agree on this issue.

<forgot to leave in his quote source> : >What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF.

The BATF is a part of the dept. of treasury, not justice.  If they needed to assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the federal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type assaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the tactical and legal parts of it.  But I suspect that the marshalls would not have touched it, because the search warrant (which is still sealed I believe) was so bogus.   Besides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from: federal marshalls service; FBI; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby large city police forces; the military.  But they had to use their own guys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun control.    	I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting.  Initial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their "assault weapon" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget was going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got confirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line); right around the presidents 100th day in office.

The best reason to abolishing the ATF is that they don't have enough to do.  If the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to the FBI (firearms) and IRS (tobacco and alcohol).  Both of these organizations have enough to do.  The FBI is probably not going to try to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken gun.   There have been postings stating that law enforcement should be divided and and weak.

Just a quick comment.  As a baptist clergyperson, I find the idea of such a "baptism" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and they seldom are regarding religion) offensive.  The pastor here seems to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent. We do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing the word is likely to be a convert.  If in fact the grace of God might work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or two. Baptist believe in regenerate membership.  Did this church include these half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? Or do they somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose? This kind of "evangelism" is certainly not baptist, and probably not very christian, either.

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight. As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna- tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find- ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless. gn

Don't tell me you don't worship Osiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson's Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British Masonry.

When he first started trying to "evangelize" me, he told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a "mystery" religion.

"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally represented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity -i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this god, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none other than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with these Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case, considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to Babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the Masonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man.  He was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of Fortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall characteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that 'Osiris was black'......."  Hislop It was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!) Nimr-rod from Nimr, a "leopard," and rada or rad "To subdue."  It is a universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or should I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the "spotted cow". I'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the "mystery" religions that all find their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to be a "cold slap to the face" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that Masonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally talked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted? -Rex

Forensic experts will study the rubble and ashes of the Branch Davidian compound, where at least 85 people, including 24 children, perished in smoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of a manipulative madman AND A STUNNING LAPSE IN JUDGMENT BY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.    [emphasis added by me] 	Investigators will re-create conditions at the compound and identify accelerants and other fac- tors fueling the inferno.  That is their strong suit. 	But the public must question why agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper- ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury. 	The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen- tia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious- ness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of arms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of rationality could be expected from Koresh, a self- confsesed "sinner without equal." 	What continues to mystify are th eactions of federal agents, who bungled the case from the start.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when 100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To- bacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent on seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap- ons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem- bers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlier oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the complex had not been adequately explored. 	Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that those deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into  the siege there was no public outcry to storm the compound. 	It had been correctly perceived that the chil- dren inside "Rancho Apocalypse" were essentially  hostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no reason for the government to be impatient.  The government's superior firepower, control of water and utilities and freedom of movement created the conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution. 	Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the FBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for abandondoning the course of patience. 	If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was growing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi- cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an M-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re- ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they would have to be weighted against the potential for eve ngreated hamr. etc etc tec.... [paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted] But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton, and inexperienced president who did not pay enough attention to the life-and -death decisions being made on WAco. 	If Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en- forcement officers--a common problem among prosecutors. 	Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must be conducted by both the executive and legislative branches.  The first step is to verify how the blaze  started.  Though apportioning blame will play a  role, it is of greater importnace to find strategies to elude the fire next time. [end of editorial] -J. Case Kim

>Of course, true or no, this is a clever attempt to make them seem harmless >folk minding their own business. Nice touch - using the word *seem*. --  The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the elimination of personal freedom.

Hey, collection.  I am interested in buying any in good condition.  I am  particularly interested in any of the older, exotic models (eg five ]  transformers into one etc...  I am looking at paying around $20-$40 depending upon the model, size and original cost etc.  I will also pay airmail postage and packing.  I am also happy to buy any old sci-fi related toys eg robots, rocketships, micronauts etc... There is only one catch.  I live in New Zealand so you have to be willing to post the items there.  I hop that someone can help me out.  Cheers Darren

Or claims to have discovered so...  It would hardly be the first time they raided someone based on incorrect evidence. > Was it a 'no-knock?' I really haven't heard anything on that. But clearly It was a "no-knock", according to the Associated Press report. Here's something I found in my collection:     Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final     Edition Monday, March 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press):     WACO, Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100     law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed     religious cult.  At least four federal agents and two cult members     were reported killed.  [...]     The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock     trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and     explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in     Washington.  [...]     Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,     throwing concussion grenades and screaming "Come out," while three     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no     response.  Then the shooting began.  I think "storming the sect's head-quaters" and "throwing concussion grenades" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault). > he was not just another guy minding his own business.

Indeed.) the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain. i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free, though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach. eliot

Organization: [via International Space University] It is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not.  The 'spaceport political publicity' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch, don't think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with the MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm, believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summer and don't worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it does occur. Stephen Horan

>I'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before. Welcome. >I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a >lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? >In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously >you aren't morally responsible for your actions. Hm. I get a little queasy around the phrase "aren't morally  responsible", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times. (I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general, most folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day and think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what "actions" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant about the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as our actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally responsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important part of that. >Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives: >1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality >applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying >to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent >thoughts. I don't know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. I've had dreams, some fairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably much better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that, than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by dreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help. >2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane') >Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in >common by more than one person. What on Earth is your definition of "often"? I know exactly one case of two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could see why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only "other plane" I know of is the spiritual realm. I don't think *anyone's* dreams, perhaps outside the occasional prophet's, represent actual actions on an alternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, then yes they would have direct moral significance. >3) Like (2), but here we assume that [garbled text: "because the dream occurs in a different environment, then different moral laws apply" is my guess of what you said.] I don't see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones "environment" changes the way a person determines what is moral. For a Christian won't it *always* come down to "what Jesus would have us do?" >So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know >of another alternative?  respond by post or email. Truth? I don't claim to be an expert in dreams. I'll note that the Bible doesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak to us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it warns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something. I would discount talk of "alternate planes," though. The only places such concepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to Christianity, though I've run into the occasional exception. If you are, or want to be, a Christian, you want to be very careful about ideas like this.

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort. She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about  what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.   For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since  Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette. our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims.

Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out >in SCI.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the  >existence of systemic yeast syndrome? I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist. No scientist would take your statement --- "no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the "crazy" theory were true, you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better.   So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative.   And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people have been talking about. But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus, it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection  incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest  that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial  because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and  mortality(mumps, measles. etc.). > -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick? > How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care. > -- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later), > does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it > not have any long term effect? Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses  mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response( new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline  with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high. Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression  but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children. > -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long > term effects? Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good  bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects  of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the  medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects  of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).   > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than > normal, and what does one do about it? Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my  opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is  normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many  infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some  physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection  frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to  result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the  length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms  associated with the infection. > -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance? There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong  immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C,  vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this  is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low  and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune  response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are  distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of  these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe  infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A  status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for  vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five  nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the  others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far. But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the  critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also  be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a  nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone( like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition. Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's  what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves  nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training  needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good  for getting general dietary advice from however. > Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much > appreciated.  Thanks a lot. >  > Ashwin.

Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim ============================================= Background:     Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving a 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800. As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.     As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments. However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I can get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the car received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment.     For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate. The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents, although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway.     Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems just as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-) Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and in front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit more difficult, but other than that, I love the size.     In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up for a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the ride later in this review. Engine:          As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha "Shogun" engine.  I was not disappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is good.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although I don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly -- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car. (More on this later.)     While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be unremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit higher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around. The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!     I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000, you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves are used. Transmission:     When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.     The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a Ford recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the one on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving.     When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter felt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect it to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's a clumsy shifter.     When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress friends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this pretty amazing in a car like this.     It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my Toyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy. Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line because of the incredibly clumsy shifter.     I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more reasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works smoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all.     Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took several days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears.)     Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to  get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple of months.     A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500 rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can definitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car, as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a "SHO sound" and is the gearbox -- apparently called "gear rollover". Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review. Exterior:     As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this SHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes don't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did differently to the SHO bodies.     The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination. :-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with "SHO" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.     I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-) Interior:     The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the car.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in a black/grey/metallic scheme.       The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo and 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a large compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding cassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small glove compartment.     I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the interior was upgraded!     The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so much space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)     The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From what I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear. Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way.     A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal hand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me. Ride:     The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than any car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I listened for that before I bought the car.     On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from Chicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.     Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would advise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason to complain.  Let me explain...     The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I avoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.     It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.     As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy. My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so useful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better than the steering on my Celica ST.     I wonder how bad this car is during winter? Miscellaneous notes:     GRIPES:     The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles         loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.     Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as 	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this. 	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)     Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension 	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.     I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the 	side bolsters would close more tightly.       I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I 	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500 	for four.     I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it 	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't 	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!! 	Pretty ridiculous, though.     Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But, 	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque 	down low.     I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It 	took me a couple of days before I could really shift 	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)     My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that 	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO.  	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make 	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled "Drive It Forever" 	for tips in this department.  :-)     The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once 	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch 	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off 	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car  	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began  	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of  	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed  	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)     The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same     	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the 	other windows work smoothly.     LIKES:     I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The     	cupholders are great.     I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but 	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by 	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And 	you can never lock yourself out of the car.     I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't 	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years  	ahead of schedule.  :-)     I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to 	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I 	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines 	and ended up with this.       If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have 	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this  	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this 	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you 	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)     Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums 	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice 	the horsepower.   Other Odds and Ends:     Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere. Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I haven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still appear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some of the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)     I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as well as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be  posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.       If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up! I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but  maybe someone out there does. Gene Kim

You are right, Michael. In John 3:5, Jesus says, "Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit."  That's really what He said, and He meant it.  That verse is the definition of baptism.  I don't have the law book in front of me, but there is a canon law that urges parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very reason that you state. --  Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock  Catechist

It originally had a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based on the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear and a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was limited as a performer. There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other models.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that were also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer 1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon, and a "sport coupe", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there were two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900 engine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also available as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights, but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio. In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last year for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing to build the GTs. The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the Manta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with Bosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and wider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century low price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US. From 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by the Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them Opels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs. Various models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the 70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition. Parts are still available from a number of sources. (I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I could collect in 20 years). --  John Kennedy                     uunet!opel!johnk Annapolis, MD
OK... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion. You see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed individuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family against this attack b) realize "oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I  better surrender" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do what they would like?  You have chosen a), and discover that the people you  defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your door waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to  charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological  warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up and will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are still holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that you can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created by the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it. I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to  surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted search warrant.   Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements regarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now  playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of  Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been held off in their assault. --  ******************************************************************************** James S.

: Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the : standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we : can ask: : 1. Is it authoritative? "Authoritative" is not a quality of the writing itself- it is a statement by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative. : 2. Is it prophetic? How is "prophecy" to be defined? If it is "speaking forth" of God's message, much of the apocrypha must surely qualify. : 3. Is it authentic? Again, by what standard?  Is "authenticity" a function of the authors? the historical accuracy?  : 4. Is it dynamic? What is this supposed to mean?  Many of the apocryphal books are highly "dynamic" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting. : 5. Is it received, collected, read and used? By whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some), collected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are, in the Catholic and Orthodox churches). : On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God. This is demonstrably false. : To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: : 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and : anachronisms. So do other books of the Bible. : 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices : which are at variance with sacred Scripture. "False" by whose interpretation?  Those churches that accept them find no contradiction with the rest of scripture.   : 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of : subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture. This is a purely subjective evaluation.  The apocryphal books demonstrate the same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures. (In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal "Additions to the Book of Esther" act rather to bring the "unscripturelike" book of Esther more into line with other books.) : 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine : Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and : poetic and religious feeling. Have you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They exhibit every bit as much "poetic and religious feeling" as Psalms or Proverbs. [deletions] : How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the : words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to : them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. : And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will : take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the : holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) : Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions. These words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone, not to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very late into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture. : It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no : argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John : 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus  : that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the  : OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51 : taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say : Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture. Jesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day, the canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books of the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of the early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e. The Torah (Pentateuch/ "Law") was established in Jesus' day, as were the Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however, were still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the Psalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all part of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated. To argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51 is weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological story.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the present order) did not exist as such in Jesus' day.

Teemu Selanne had 3 goals, Keith Tkachuk had one, and Luciano Borsato scored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the Canucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1.  Trevor Linden and Pavel Bure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause. Selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay goals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon. Hard work paid off tonight for the Jets, and if the Jets continue to exhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (I woofed last year when we were up 3-1...I ain't going to do THAT again.  I'll have to be quietly happy with a solid performance.  ;) Daryl Turner : r.s.h contact for the Winnipeg Jets  FidoNET: 1:348/701 -or- 1:348/4  (please route through 348/700) Tkachuk over to Zhamnov, up to Sel{nne, he shoots, he scores!

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context >should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander >-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us. The story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity  to "know" the two men who were Lot's guests; the fact that the Sodomites became  angry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they  were interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was  rape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some  Christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as  sinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it  was that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended  rape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible  alternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those  who believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying  to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape. You seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the  fact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to  "stigmatize" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can  see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion  that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we're not  supposed to start from our conclusions because that's circular reasoning.  If  God is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more  probably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites'  blatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I  will document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises  *any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults. >>"...

And such  >were  >>some of you..."  I Cor. 6:9-11. >  >The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_ >in this.   The moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church  as the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be  legitimate, and thus the church's refusal to recognize "perverted" marriages  was circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the  church ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a  straw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise  definition/translation of "porneia" isn't really important, unless you are  trying to argue that the Bible doesn't really condemn extramarital sex.  I'm  not sure the moderator was trying to do that. In any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.   When Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, "Have you not read, that He who  created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this  cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and  the two shall become one flesh'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one  flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." (Mt.  19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife  (female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of  heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men,  and not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this  union, in Jesus' words, because it is not something created by men. This is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God's word.  I read in the  Bible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any  similar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there  have been uninspired men who have ordained "alternative" unions (isn't Caligula  reported to have "married" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to  as "what God has joined together" is the heterosexual union of a man and his  wife. (Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that's probably inflammatory, and I  should save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.   Please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of  my reply.) Anyway, my original question was not whether we should translate "porneia" in a  way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was:  given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as  divinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of  marriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we  need to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You  seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and  other sins) are really wrong: >>I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of >activity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or >"reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may >or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very >fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at >all "clear" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest >in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions, >with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated >Christian discussion of ALL these areas. Alternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as "porneia" and all  the rest was, in Paul's day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the  "tutor" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen  centuries drumming into the heads of God's people the idea that things like  homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.   Perhaps Paul didn't go into detail on what "porneia" &c were because after 1600  years he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the  reason God's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining  a distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any  significant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.   I'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just  wanted to point out that the New Testament's failure to develop a detailed new  standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about  sexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for  practicing homosexuality! >Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I >know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and >child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly >"harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -- >that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter >you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that >you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?] >  >        "'I am free to do anything,' you say.

Some >people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior. >It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary >argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such >behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers. And how do you define an "obsessively driven" mode of sexual behavior?  How do  you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex  drives?  Is the desire to have "sinful" sex an obsessively driven mode of  behavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined  as sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that  the person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful.  Or is it obsessive  because it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that's  circular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even  though society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is  obsessive. You seem to be trying to limit the Bible's condemnation of "porneia" to only  "perverted" sex acts, but I don't think you can really define "perverted"  without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.  What,  then, is Paul condemning when he declares that "Fornicators...shall not enter  the kindgom of heaven"? >I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially. >Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your >assumption that you know what _porneia_ means. I think you misunderstood me:  I was not trying to make an argument on some  technical definition of "porneia", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness  of extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual  counterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples. >There are plenty of >laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of >which Christians ignore completely.

Please remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality, in part  2. >On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you >say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part >of the ritual law? I am glad you asked.  Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual  intercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this  would show that God's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual  law?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual  behavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that  God's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to  just the ritual law and those who are under the Law? I've been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the  subject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping  requirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to  rest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on  the Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements  such as "Thou shalt not kill", and requirements that are merely part of the  (temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath. The point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of  homosexual intercourse as "an abomination" is *just* a part of the temporary,  Jews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by  God as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those  guilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here's why: Back in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in  the possession of "the Amorite"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don't you think?   But in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:   it seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because "the  iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete". Remember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the  iniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his  being cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18  again.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest,  homosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, "Do  not defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the  nations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the  land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so  the land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these  abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their  people." Notice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of  Moses) are about to be punished because they have "defiled" themselves and  their land by committing "abominations" that include incest, bestiality, and  homosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these  same "abominations" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on  anyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man "lying  with another man as one lies with a woman" (Lv. 20:13).  Their  "bloodguiltiness" was upon them, meaning that in God's eyes, they deserved to  die for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even "the alien  [non-Jew] who sojourns among you" was to refrain from these practices, on  penalty of being "cut off [by God?] from among their people." Under the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the  claim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not  the homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list  sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the  Canaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay  sex), I'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even  by those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant. >For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can >be "law" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about) >it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to >determine why you "pick" one and ignore another. According to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable  for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I  believe that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can  learn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is  a violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law  (for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain  actions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I  conclude that God's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a  person is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case  of homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling  abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the  Law as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that  Gentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply  saying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not  obligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to  our exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has  declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.

>As for the picks >Ottawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will  >go #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec. I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked, and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a rock.  Also remember that a lot of teh "draft 1st" stuff comes from the assumption he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that  Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point. It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos suspensions. >IMO I would >take Kariya.

No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not leaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can convince him to leave school early (which I doubt).

HB 1776 is for Concealed Carry in Texas.  It provides for licensing citizens to carry concealed firearms if they pass an instruction course (30 hours, if I remember correctly), pay a $140 fee (good for 4 years), and meet several other criteria related to personal character, etc. While I don't agree with all of the criteria, I feel it's high time that pro-gun types fight the same way HCI et al. do -- by getting incremental changes in the law.

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address: NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!! LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!! Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

>Oh yeah...and I CAN go to the Arena and see not one, not two, but >*six* championship banners hanging from the rafters.  3 Stanley Cup >banners, and 3 Avco Cup banners.  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has >won the Cup once (as many times as the rockin' town of Kenora has won it!) Don't let this confuse anybody.  The Winnipeg Jets have never won the Stanley Cup (or even come that close).  These Stanley Cup championships go back a LONG way to about the turn of the century.  The Winnipeg Victorias won one or more of these Cups- the Jets didn't win any of them. Can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff series going on today than who won more Stanley Cups around the turn of the century?? Lets face facts.  The Canucks are leading the series 3-1.  The Canucks dominated the Jets in their season series.  The Canucks did better in the regular season than Winnipeg.  Who is the better team?  I think that the facts show that Vancouver is better than Winnipeg. Gregmeister

As a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptions of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lack belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no reason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the word agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of a god is unknown inherently unknowable.  Note that this is a positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a god; I do not believe in a god, but I also do not believe the agnostic claim. Russell
: >Why not build a inflatable space dock. : If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in : a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing. That's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked "Why not," I'll respond. Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to  incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable). Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today. Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable. The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation effects on materials), so your "fabric" may not retain any flexibility for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases. These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success. -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      "Good ideas are common -- what's uncommon are people who'll       work hard enough to bring them about." -- Ashleigh Brilliant
Some of the MD's in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good (maybe in some cases with good reason).  In this post on depression, I'm  laying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I have  some knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, you  should know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future. >  > A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on > by menopause as well as a mental break down.

Both my wife and I suffered from  bouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a  rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and  chemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through  her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When  severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to  use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had "cured" her PMS using  supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet  in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and  she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after  by wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and  one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another  stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with  supplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac.  I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using  B6, niacin, folate and B12 to "cure" depression.  I'm not going to do that  because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was. Lida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the  problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use  an approach which will "fix" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly  what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be  affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these  stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was  pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is  a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your  bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C),  you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any  nutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from  being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase  your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become  very important. Lida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to  try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming  from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic  Medical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because  none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I  preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by  my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover: Indroduction and Carbohydrates 			Lipids Proteins I					Proteins II Energy Balance					Evaluation of Nutritional 						Status I, A Clinical  						Perspective Evaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional		 A Biochemical Perspective			Status III, Homework  						Assignment Using the  						Nutritionist IV Diet and  						Fitness Analysis Software  						program Weight Control					Food Fads and Facts Age-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements	Food Additives,  						Contaminants and Cancer Drug-Nutrient Interactions			Mineral and Water Balance Sodium, Potassium and Chloride			Calcium, Magnesium and  						Phosphorus Iron						Zinc and Copper Iodine and Fluoride				Other Trace Minerals Vitamin A					Vitamin E Vitamins D and K				Vitamin C Thiamin and Niacin				Riboflavin and Pyridoxine Pantothenic and Folic acids			Biotin and B12 Other Nutrient Factors				Enteral Nutrition Parenteral Nutrition Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature  to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this  in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down  and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books  that have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which  I write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various  copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for  educational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not  send this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do). I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition  assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need  to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the  nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to  be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to  design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment  Centers of America, which is a private for-profit organization with  hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a  nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin  Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup. For physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new  Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I  have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown  series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more  to residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it  does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a  patient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the  Preface of this new text: "So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists,  hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge  of nutrition as it related to their field of practice."   "Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United  States require no formal instruction in nutrition." "But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the  leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related." "... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it  should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of  nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your  awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important  for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially  every organ system." Roland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH  Lida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find  a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals (yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and  who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when  women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are  occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A  nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned  that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red  cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium  reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to  try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are  also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral  analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using  certified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some  pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone  who will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are  using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory  Improvement Act).   A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown  to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging  and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But  there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not  show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status. Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the  U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional  profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses  diet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue  to be the best approach to depression.

Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion). I'll give you some examples. 	1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no  	   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication. 	2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid  	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss. 	3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has  	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by  	   the NCI. These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should  not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of  which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal  agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be  having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of  commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to  relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures, others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a  chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the  healer's oath, "I will do no harm".  But you know David that very few  treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a  very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each  physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some  are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive  approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long  as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake  in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in  the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as  quacks or even unethical. What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.   These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the  frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are  really doing a pretty good job of providing "alternative" medicine.  But  many lack any formal training and are in the "business" simply to make a  few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting  competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative  care area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find  someone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of  money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo- medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the  liscened physicians). I hope that this clears things up David. Marty B.

The following is a juxtaposition of part of an ancient text known as "de Sacramentis", usually attributed to St. Ambrose of Milan, and the canon of the traditional Catholic Mass of the Roman rite.  The conclusion from this comparison is that the central part of the traditional Roman canon was already fairly well in place by sometime in the late 4th century. Taken from "The Mass of the Western Rites", by the Right Reverend Dom Fernand Cabrol, Abbot of Farnborough, 1934, without permission. Excerpted from Chapter VI: THE MASS AT ROME, FROM THE FIFTH TO THE SEVENTH CENTURIES.  The paragraph at the end is from the book, not me. Sorry about the long lines.

Melchisedech offered unto                                                                 Thee, a holy sacrifice and                                                                 a spotless victim.                                 Supplices te rogamus,           Most humbly we implore                                 perferri per manus sancti       these offerings to be                                 Angeli tui in sublime altare    brought by the hands of                                 tuum in conspectu divinae       Thy holy angel unto Thy                                 majestatis tuae: etc.           altar above; before the                                                                 face of Thy Divine                                                                 Majesty; etc. There is no doubt that we have here two editions of the same text; and as that of De Sacramentis is localised in Upper Italy and dated about the year 400, it is the most ancient witness we possess as to the principal parts of the Roman canon, which only appear in the Sacramentaries some time after the seventh century. The question as to whether the Roman canon is not older even than that of De Sacramentis is discussed by liturgiologists.  Mgr. Batiffol is of this opinion, but we, on the contrary, think that the former bears traces of closer composition, of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy, and that consequently it is a text corrected from De Sacramentis. We shall see, in studying the list of names in the Memento of the living and that of the dead, that Mgr. Batiffol argues with good reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of Symmachus (498-514). We thus have the state of the Roman Mass, or at least of the chief parts of the canon, at the beginning of the fourth century.

I turned back to ESPN around 11 and it was hockey. Great, I pulled up a chair and watched, then the first overtime period  ended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey something like 30 minutes later. Are they trying to alienate both hockey and baseball viewers at the same time. As for Martinsville, I wonder why they even bothered to sign up for it when they it was no secret that it coincided with the draft. Why not let TNN broadcast it ? George

>However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and >Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and >delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is >a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.   I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first "modern" coach. Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room in the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulates the press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important games listen to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to what is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups.  Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free  in OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach! I am left asking "What is a modern coach if not Bowman?" -jake.

There's more than a little difference between formulating foreign policy and overseeing the ATF's handling of a scenario involving a group of religious fanatics. Why do people compare apples and oranges?
We have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration. Let me ask  a similar question from the aviation field. You must have seen images of prop  planes with all cylinders exposed. I have seen up to 8 cylinders positioned  radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle.  This arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma. How can one crankshaft  throw accomodate 8 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the  outside. Bijan

>Small arms rounds set off outside of a firearm pose little risk except >possibly eye injuries and minor wounds.   True. >Large concentrations of ammo, >or 'magazines' (not the type you insert into your semi auto) probably >pose a larger risk, but mostly from heat and flame.  (This is also >covered in the above reference.) No more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder. Two  years ago this month my house and office burned.  In my office was my reloading bench.  On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was  about 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20 and .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the  reloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2" of char on the joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other words. None of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited. No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do. The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids completely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case of the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away. Many of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood on all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the rifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were found still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into  the wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually dislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets. The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around. No dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard. Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless of what the FBI says.   John --  John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

Thanks for the responses so far. I hope that I have  sparked some thought (which is more my intent than  to restart one of the Reformations). I'm just going to tug on two threads: >	And I must point out that >the Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the founding >of the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to a >canon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitian >use of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?   I was simply observing that as a non-Jew, I am not in that community which might be bound by such a decision (I don't know much about the Council of Jamnia, but I have heard that it is not well-attested historically). 'Faithless' has nothing to do with it, and I prefer not to speculate about motives. >As early >as 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the >Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.   I wish the Dialogue_with_Trypho were a real transcript of a real dialogue,, but I think it a fictional effect on Justin's part. Putting that to one side, Justin's point may be evidential; one would want to know- 'which books?' >Protestants apparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited  >by a decree of the Jews [...] Perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light (MS evidence) they had. Let's stick to the issues. Again, I prefer not to speculate about motives. One would need quotes from Luther, Calvin, etc. to evidence this 'preference'. ----- >That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book >of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  >apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.   Is this the principle: 'Any (BC) text not quoted by Christ cannot be counted as Scripture' ? Think well about this- Job, Ruth...? I wrote:  		These is a logically invalid *a priori*.   		Besides, we are talking about OT texts-   		which in many parts are superceded by the NT  		(in the Xtian view). Would not this same  		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?  		This principle cannot be consistently applied. Dave W. answers:   >I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one >voice, and he does not contradict himself.   Meaning what? Do you affirm the principle (that the D.c's can be excluded since they contain 'false doctrine') or do you deny it?  If affirmed (as is implied in your statement) how does one determine  that doctrine X is false? Do you affirm every teaching in _Ecclesiastes_? >The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired >by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more >guided by faith than by reason or logic.   If so, it may be a test that cannot be applied. The Orthodox faithfully believe that Psalm 151 is canonical. How can my faith say 'Not!' ? All I hear here is the *a priori* I mentioned before. >The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's >history.   This is contrary to fact. >They do not have the same spiritual quality as the >rest of Scripture.   Can this be elevated to a principle? How is 'spiritual quality' measured? I'll take the 'spiritual quality' of most of Sirach over  Joshua or Chronicles, any day. >I do not believe the church that added these >books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.   What can I say? You believe what you believe- I'm asking for a consistency check. I don't see that the books were added- in any construction this formulation begs the question. No one can validly ask me to 'have faith' that these books are noncanonical. These are my opinions & activities alone QOTD: "Christianity is not a doctrine, not, I mean, a theory about what has  happened and will happen to the human soul, but a description of something  that actually takes place in a human life.  For `consciousness of sin' is a  real event, and so are despair and salvation through faith.  Those who speak  of such things (Bunyan, for instance) are simply describing what has happened  to them, whatever anyone may want to say about it." -- Ludwig Wittgenstein
I'd appreciate any help anyone could give me on these two questions:   The Brady Bill was in the news throughout 1992 but what actually happened to it in Congress?  Did Bush veto it?  If so, when?   Also, the state of Virginia, I believe, just passed a gun control bill on Febrauary 25 of this year.  I think it limits gun purchases to one a month - is this correct?  What was the bill number?   Anyone?

In my case, removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and I've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store - I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything. One question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining trapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming, too.  It works, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let any water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.  Any comments?
   I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, I just wanted to add a point.    The whole question of "a right to a dark sky" revolves around the definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and good, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution provides a "Bill of Rights" from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries have comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the U.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law and the International Court of Justice (correct name?) in the Hague, something I know little about. Doug Loss
I wrote that I thought that 2 Peter 1:20 meant, "no prophecy of Scripture (or, as one reader suggests, no written prophecy) is merely the private opinion of the writer." Tony Zamora replies (Sat 8 May 1993) that this in turn implies that it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader either. I am not sure that I understand this.      In one sense, no statement by another is subject to my private interpretation. If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians lost the Pelopennesian War, I cannot simply interpret this away because I wanted the Athenians to win. Facts are facts and do not go away because I want them to be otherwise.      In another sense, every statement is subject to private interpretation, in that I have to depend on my brains and expereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficiently well attested to merit my assent. Even if the statement occurs in an inspired writing, I still have to decide, using my own best judgement, whether it is in fact inspired. This is not arrogance -- it is just an inescapable fact.

Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two in combination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of  available water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike recently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters). I drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was dehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue, since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general stamina, so far as I could tell. It may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I am wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things. I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma (24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both those drugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they can reduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be a particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather exercise?  (I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, but that wasn't the case yesterday.)

What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal suffering?  If it is Biblical, please reference. Here's my train of thought: If God is using the Earth to manufacture heavenly beings, then it is logical that there would be a certain yield, and a certain amount of waste.  The yield goes to Heaven, and the waste is burned (destroyed) in Hell.  Why is it necessary to punish the waste, rather than just destroy it? Peace and joy, Dale Wyttenbach

I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that we did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.   This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are usually more complex than this example I will use here.         Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds, its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.         Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a R=8800Mpc.           We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the old standby formula:                         Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak         For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec. And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call moderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second?                                                  -jeremy
While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of Christianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious beliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma to the point of misrepresentation. There are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus, Jains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.) To refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally incorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.  Karma is considered to be a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape a person's predilections for future intention and action and produce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite -- "reward" has nothing to do with it.  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usually described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact "As you sow, so shall you reap" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor of natural growth is explicit. Hinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being theistically inclined. In point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia considers karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics of karma without the element of free will. Also in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and rebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations. Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation among Christian thinkers?  What were his views, and how did he relate them to the Christian scriptures? Jack Carroll

The previous one was called "Smiley".  1992 QB1 = Smiley, and 1993 FW = Karla. Note that neither name is official.  It seems the discoverers have an aversion to the designation scheme. By the way, 1992 QB1 can never be known as "Smiley" officially, because that moniker has already been assigned to asteroid number 1613.

Yes, its a horrible way to go, but apparently not so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to  carry it through. And, since they've discovered bullet wounds in a couple of  the bodies from the compound, there is the possiblity that those with the will power to self immolate also had the will power to take out the ones who had less constitutional fortitude. Then again, maybe the FBI ran in while the fire was raging, executed those two, and ran out again. Jason Durbin Oracle Europe

I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes (type II, I guess--no insulin).  I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known.  Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the weight gain.  For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off.  Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much interest, like bread on the waters. With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can suggest is to make it as gradual as possible. Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which- parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty. Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly understood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk ("It's strep; give him this and he'll get well.") and so my expectations are too high?  Bonita Kale

I presume that during a re-boost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter with the orbiter bay doors shut; but still there would be lots of contamination worries.  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to  keep clean. But I still don't know where the idea is coming from that HST _NEEDS_ a re-boost.

The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are all critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented gridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor, either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that G. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting straight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad it can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a good G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G. A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. Anyone have any figures? Ray Fairfield

[Much discussion about economics of safety deleted] >Safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car. I won't buy a  >small car like a Civic or whatever. > >Great = Safety + Handling + Speed  -  for me > >Seems to me that you would be more "dead" in a small car than a large car  >after an accident. This is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision (less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last generation Suburban HIC numbers).  As an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that seatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt  will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be saved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are wearing no seat belt?  Craig > >- gerrit >

I recently purchased an IBM monochrome vga monitor from Mike Damico. The monitor arrived but it was missing it's power cable. Mike's address is apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it. If anyone knows how to contact Mike and could help me find him I would appreciate it. I am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor but it would be a lot more useful to me if I had the cord as well.

Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Does  short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after the use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although the drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  It seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the course of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that the combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part catalysts for this.  Any comments? --

 I'm looking for an old album or cassette tape. The group is Sanford/Townsend the name of the album is 'Smoke from a Distant Fire' (I think). This album came out somewhere around  1975-76, and I believe was the first album produced by Kenny Loggins after he and Jim Messina broke up. If you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it, great. If you don't want to part with it, but are willing to copy it onto cassette I'd love that too. Thanks JK
>...I'm not asking anyone here to buy into "The Yeast Connection" book >because I don't know what's in that book, plain and simple. And to be honest >with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never written. I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way it was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeast connection". But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In the meantime, I'd still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinus problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It is an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT says "sorry, you'll just have to live with it", it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence (Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At this stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with relatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of course, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you.

Relay of coverage seen: ---------------------- There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier  today (Wednesday).  It was explained that two news photographers were found  on the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained  to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer  turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous  by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)   The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and  the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.   It was also emphasized that the survey of the "crime" scene at this  point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere. The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the  site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.   That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my  memory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it  and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will  probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow. My opinions: ----------- I find this disturbing.  While I believe that Koresh is largely  responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the  last 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the  aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize. Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are  already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court  case seems overblown to me. It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair.  I have also  heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government  enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good  idea in previous months. Please also note that I by no means endorse  or agree with the many  conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups.  As usual,  I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered  by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, IMHO.  As such,  my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available. Scott Roby                                                Standard Disclaimer --

This request goes out to medical students who have done or are planning to sit the USMLE (or National Boards) Part 1. My wife is sitting this examination in early June this year and would like to have a look at some old National Boards, Part 1 questions found in the following books. These books are currently out of print.   The books are: (1) Retired NBME Basic Medical Science Test Items, NBME;     Published by NBME in 1991 (2) Self-test in the Part 1 Basic Medical Sciences, NBME;     Published by NBME in 1989 I would appreciate if anyone who has these books is willing to loan it to her for a couple of days. Obviously, I would reimburse for you all postage and related charges. Failing that it would be beneficial if anyone could point to any library in the NY, NJ or PA area that may have these books. Please respond by e-mail since I do not read this newsgroup regularly. Thanks in advance. Daniel

To just about everyone. I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except two.  As far as I am concerned, I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise. The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given  NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally, in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly  cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded "national exposure," but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it. The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript. We'll never know if he would have kept that one. > 	The FBI etc. can't wait forever for Koresh to come out.

It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to "go state's evidence," parrot the FBI story, hang the whole "suicide" on Koresh,  claim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc.  If any of them do this in the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them do, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is dead wrong. --

I don't believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep 	the peace; the Church in the United States feels the same way, thus the 	reason that the Catholic Church has opposed every execution in this 	country in recent memory. >As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church's teaching on capital >punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total >accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly >force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.

: You might want to re-think your attitude about the Holocaust after : reading Deuteronomy chapter 28. On the contrary, after the Holocaust, I would be _very_ cautious about my interpretatoin of Deuteronomy 28.  Not everything that happens is in accordance with God's will.  (You might guess which side of the predestination issue I am on.)  I will never _assume_ that evil is  punishment by God, especially when I am speaking of the evil that falls on _someone else_.  For my own life, I will work to discern the hand of God in the evil that befalls _me_. See the discussion earlier on Luke 13. (unreconstructed arminian)

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building Keck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, "This second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away."   Japan's 8.3-meter Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes! And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research was done with "Star Wars" funding, and some is now being shared with astronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their  theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere. To say that "visible light astronomy is already a dying field" is  pure hokum.  To use the "logic" that things are already bad, so it doesn't matter if it gets worse is absurd.  Maybe common sense and logic are the dying fields.

Sorry, I put my foot in my mouth, concerning the church's history. It is correct to say that the Council of Hippo 393 listed the  deuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in the church, and that this was ratified by the Council of Carthage, and by Pope Innoent I and Gelasius I (414 AD). Yet Eerdman's History of the Church says:  "At the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard to the extent of the canon, or the number of the books which should be acknowledged as divine and authoritative.    The Jewish canon, or the Hebrew bible, was universally  received, while the Apocrypha added to the Greek version of the Septuagint were only in a general way accounted as books suitable for church reading, and thus as a middle class between canonical and strictly apocryphal (pseudonymous) writings. And justly; for those books, while they have great historical value, and fill the gap between the Old Testament and the New, all originated after the cessation of prophecy, and the cannot be therefore regarded as inspired, nor are they ever cited by Christ or the aposteles." "In the Western church the canon of both Testaments was closed at the end of the fourth century through the authority of Jerome (who wavered, however, between critical doubts and the principle of tradition), and more especially of Augustine, who firmly followed the Alexandrian canon of the Septuagint, and the preponderant tradition in reference to the Catholic Epistles and the Revelation; though he himself, in some places, inclines to consider the Old Testament Apocrypha as *deutero* canonical, bearing a subordinate authority." This history goes on to say that Augustine attended both the Council of Hippo and of Carthage. It is interesting to note, however, the following footnote to the fourth session of the Council of Trent.  The footnote  lists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical  books, but then says "The Tridentine list or decree was the first *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration on the Canon of the Holy Scriptures." Which leads one to think that the RC canon was not official until Trent.  Thus my previous erroneous statement was not entirely groundless. It is also interesting to note that the Council of Trent went on to uphold "the old Latin Vulgate Edition" of  the Scriptures as authentic.  Which, I would suppose,  today's Catholic scholars wish the Council had never said. Also the council made no distinction between deutero-canonical and canonical books--in contrast to (Eerdman's statement of) the fourth century views. David Wagner a confessional Lutheran
   For the moment, forget about BATF incompetence or FBI hubris.  Did anybody catch Rep. Charles Shumer on the news last night holding up a .50 BMG cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed to own one of these.  (I presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)   So what's your guess for the upcoming anti-gun agenda: 1.   A ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 BMG) 2.   A ban on "sniper rifles" 3. A ban on "stockpiling" guns and ammunition. BTW: Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on      the news. I wonder how he finds the floor in the morning. ------- MICHAEL F. GORDON "Vote as you shot."  (19th Cent Republican campaign slogan ) Shumer is not mis-informed, he knows full well what he is doing. If you look at his other votes, and positions as an agent of redistribution of wealth & property in this country, to him guns and personal freedom  are incompatible with his obvious world-view. They are a threat to the 'order' he would impose. 	R -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "It [collectivism vs individualism] is an ancient conflict.

1954 MG-TF with frame-up restoration in early '70's - a local show winner! Driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt & dust.  Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T's) but otherwise ready to run.  Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent. The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  It is priced at $12,000. 1953 MG-TD Good shape but hasn't been run since '70's.  Needs engine work, but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500. 1952 MG-TD Basket Case.  I'd call it a parts car, but it's too good for that.  Everything seems to be there except the tach.  Would make a good project car or parts car if you insist.  No apparent rust but the upholstery is a disaster.  Stored inside since the '70's.  The top was new but now soso.  This one has wire wheels!  Looking for $4,500. All three cars will be sold "as they stand" with no hassles or haggles. Time has passed by and it is time to part company.  Prices are negotiable.                                        315-341-3501   Oswego, NY 13126 --  Oswego, NY 13126        ALLOY NTNX-PC    MHO's are mine, not S.U.N.Y. Oswego's.

I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I  ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice,  which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370  miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put  together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000  cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but  considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the  new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a  shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next  year (according to a WSJ article).   Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in  Popular Mechanics.

I came across the following notice in the Denver Post classified secction this morning (April 26, 1993): \begin{quote} NOTICE: The Denver Post will no longer knowingly accept any advertisement to buy or sell assault weapons.  The Denver Post finds that the use of assault weapons poses a threat to the health, safety, and security of its readers. \end{quote} Now I suppose the Post is within its rights to refuse such ads.  However, the second sentence is so noxious, I feel compelled to bring it to the  attention of the t.p.g/c.g readership.   I called the Post classified number (825-2525) and expressed my displeasure.  According to the supervisor I spoke to, the Post was reacting to public complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads.  However, she said the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy.  I  strongly encourage Denver Post readers to call and make their feelings known. Eric E.

[The only reason for the death penalty is revenge?? If you are going to try to refute a position, try to refute the whole position or acknosledge that you are only speaking to small piece of the problem. Broad sweeping "the only reason, " etc on as tough nut to crack as the death penalty reallly doesn't help much. Every year the FBI releases crime stats showing an overwhelming amount of crime is committed by repeat offenders. People are killed by folks who have killed (who knows how many times) before. How aobut folks who are for the death penalty, not for revenge, but to cut down on recidivism?]   Your point is well taken. I acknowledge the fact that there are some who take this position. Sorry about that. Of course, I still believe that the vast majority of those who favor the death penalty, do so for reason of seeking vengeance. I'm curious, if you favor the death penalty to keep killers from killing again, what do you think we should do with people who commit other crimes, such as rape or robbery? Isn't it the Muslims who cut your hand off if you're caught stealing?

But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of the coverage to the Pens.  On Tuesday night, they continued to broadcast the Pen-Devil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control. Granted they did show some "bonus" coverage of the Caps and Isles but they cut away from the close game, which went into double ot, to update us on the fifth goal of the rout. Thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between the pens and devils.  IMHO they should program some variety into the telecasts.(Yes I know the game shown on saturday is between the B's and Sabres, probably throwing a bone to us Bruin fans.)

THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN. Maybe they get the wrong address and then raid *your* home, for example. It's happened before and it can happen *again*.  I have heard of more than one instance of a no-knock raid going sour.  Just recently I heard about a case in which police raided this guy's home because they thought he had dope or something.  The guy blew both of the officers away and he didn't go to jail for it.  The judge hearing the case ruled that the man was acting in self-defense. > With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with > mega fire power.

Are you sure that that would have been the way to go?  Surely the FBI and ATF could have handled this fiasco better.  They didn't have to massacre all those people.  As Stimpy said in "Fake Dad", "Shame, shame, double shame!"  The FBI and ATF should be ashamed of theirselves.

Of course, if you re willing to buy blind, you can put a $2 advertisement in the Antiquarian Bookseller's newsletter (the exact title of which escapes me at the moment.)  _Five Weeks in a Balloon_ is not the rarest of Jules Verne books.  Someone has it for sale somewhere, and the AB is the way to  find it.  In fact, I would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers of sale.  Of course, that takes the fun out of hunting for it yourself... Good luck. -Scott --------------------                          New .sig under construction Scott I.

Wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston. Which Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston let Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and another BIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why Grant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered a minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I think Boston would have notched their first win of the series. Well, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but I certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually, they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt that would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I think Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging a new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not gonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey. Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev deflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a tesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in the opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in such ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres won a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game) when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his shot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting it up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming, "They score, THEY SCORE!!!".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping up and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating over to Brad May who he jumped on. Doug McKee
An aquaintence has a 87 Accord.  The driver's side headrest was accidentally put in backwards and has jammed.  According to the dealer, the only way to get it out is to spend several hours disassembling the seat.  This is the second time I have heard of this happening, and I wonder whether there's an easier way to get the headrest back out.  Has anyone else ever dealt with this problem? Your advice would be appreciated!

I believe that Phil Esposito was the first to wear #77 when he played with the Rangers in the '70s.  This was the season that they put the Rangers crest and "modern-style" numbers on the jerseys instead of the "NEW YORK" or "RANGERS" block letters and two-colour numbers.  He took #77 because the Rangers already had a #7. (Hockey Night in Canada made a big thing out of it, saying it was the biggest uniform style change in a long time.

Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met this doctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown. They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first time? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but on the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met him with my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there for and took a history, all before I undressed.   Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor for the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor on something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If nothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.   Does anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk attitude as insensitive? Also, is it unusual?

I would have to say that the "greatest philosopher" title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did  definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it was Descartes who said that "All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato." If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle. This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as "the philosopher". Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though. As for "modern" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and  amplified them over time). I would say that the most influential "american" philosopher would have to be Dewey. But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect was "American", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen. --Brian
      _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely       no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have       to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to       "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching       by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at       least it was a good try...    So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances? I don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)    Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star    hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for    implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of    models. Hmm, the "superbowl" burst has been claimed in press releases to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what I've read (and I haven't seen the papers, only the press) I'd say it is consistent with some of the merging NS models    A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came    through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this    Here is the abstract of that paper.  ...       indicator to these events all possible sources which are       isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is       why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,       although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs       from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs       originate in the solar cometary cloud       cannot be excluded until it is disproved. This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no, anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference. That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known) are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution... *  Steinn Sigurdsson   			Lick Observatory      	* *  The laws of gravity are very,very strict			* *  And you're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*
During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr, MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman. Despite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing adantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens bottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to configure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible. Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed of Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As a result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played almost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern scored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night. His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about success. While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson, Bowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearly seen, mark in  Pittsburgh.

David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,    'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or    part of the Oort cloud.    Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge    of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there    isn't a mechanism for the others either. What on Earth is the "gravisphere"? Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they  detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances. In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin. _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell.

On 20 April, Stephen McIntyre writes:  > I would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in  > Heaven knowing that even one man would spend his "eternal life"  > being scorched for his wrongdoings.... Stephen, I suspect that when you and I use the word "Hell," we have different concepts in mind. When you encounter references to Heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do not suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden streets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the concept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that about the "fires" of Hell?      Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the last description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the Ferris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant by Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this connection, there are two reasons that occur to me.      The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart -- but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS SHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with matches).      The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word "Gehenna," one of the words translated "Hell" in the New Testament. It refers to the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a place where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive) to Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires burned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem. "To be cast into Gehenna" or "to burn in Gehenna" thus became a metaphor for "to be rejected or discarded as worthless." Lest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart is my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT DIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no flames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most bookstores and libraries.  Yours,  James Kiefer
Does anyone have a reference (something I can look up, not just your own recollections -- I have a few of those myself) on the temperature of the (night) sky as seen from space? Note, I am *not* talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background Radiation.  There are more things in the sky than just the MBR; what I'm after is total blackbody temperature -- what a thermal radiator would see, disregarding (or shielding against) the Sun and nearby large warm objects. My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is substantially higher than that of the MBR, once you figure in things like stars and the zodiacal light, but I'd like numbers. --

The paper was quite interesting, as I recall. This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior to us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced and therefore "more intelegent" that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there is life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.

My question however was more along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night. Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved these issues on our own? But... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided that certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no homelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and more.  If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in houses, farm the land and go to church on sunday? --  Have a day,    ( )     bobo

-> The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version -> of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then. How unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which 302 and 351 Fords and 305 and 350 Chevys can be built up. Still, it will provide a needed punch for the Ford to stay up with the new Firebird/Camaros. It wouldn't surprise me if Ford called the engine a 5.0 litre in the Mustang. (We all know that the current 5.0 is really 4.9 litres anyway) -> Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new -> Camaro/Firebird, IMO. I must agree.

I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried  out!  When you think "your army" is stronger than "mine", you would  "righteously" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is  really "best" for them.    You cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the  context of the teachings of Jesus/God.

Is this >trend continuning?  This is not a trend. The Caps were done. Goneso in five games, and it saves us Caps fans a lot of pain. I mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them  tumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times have they done that in their history? 1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight 1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight 1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight In other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they  were a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being  1) a sweep of Philly in 1984 2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME  they managed to get out of the division. Actually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples: 1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1, gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the last minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot. Series tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later. 2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd  period, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games. 3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period. Blew it and the series. 4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it. 5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period. Blew it again. When they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: "if they blew this lead, the series is OVER". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders believe they can come back no matter what the score is. I am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can  completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear  lives in a crucial game. >The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan. >P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh! Well, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps were frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking "wait until Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire". Well, they retired (even though Trottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another generation of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well, I guess  it has nothing to do with the players. --                                            Edward Lor

: Recently an e-mail to me mentioned: : (Technically, the messengers aren't even human so : it *can't* be a case of "homosexuality" -- even of rape.) [...] : The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of : the Sodomites' "lust" for the "other flesh" of angels.  Again, : application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of : gay Christians is largeely specious. : *** : Are angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because : of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world). : what are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse   : at all. Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing the elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  Hence, those who were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension, God); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike: 	"Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament, 	refer to idolatry, while "flesh" (as in I Pet 1:24)  	denotes human society and its violent attempts at self- 	exaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders 	of apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to 	their followers." [p. 199] There is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring to actual sexual lust for "alien flesh".  Nor is it inherently necessary to understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin of homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and not merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 "This was the guilt of your sister bit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it. For the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent's suggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.  There  are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the Sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.

Like I said before,  I can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy  ceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  In fact, all  four gospels record the first "breaking of the bread" in some detail.   Communion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my  opinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of  the Body of Christ.  The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal  meals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during  communion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact  hiding shameful things from the general public.  In fact, I think if you read  some of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all  bashful about describing what went on during communion.  That's why it seems  funny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st  century Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they  are "too sacred." - Mark [Actually, that's not quite the case.  John omits the central elements of the Last Supper.  His Gospel is full of symbolism of bread and wine.  But the actual story isn't there.  Some people think he has omitted some of the details because they were not talked about in public in his community.  There is also evidence that some aspects of baptismal practice were kept secret. See Morton Smith's "Secret Gospel" -- I don't agree with his lurid speculations on what the secret practices actually were, but there does seem to be some evidence that Mark omitted certain details because they were  inappropriate for publication.  --clh]

But then, the fact that not all languages have a WRITTEN gospel lends no credence to the  concept of "pentecost" type xenoglossolalia since most tongues occur not in these places of un-written language, but rather in churches full of people who do have a written language and a Bible in that language. But I nitpick.
Don't know who scored, but the Isles (28-7 franchise record in playoff OT games) took game four by a score of 4-3 for their third consecutive OT win over the Capitals tonight at Uniondale. If you know, please post who scored for a Isles fan living in Atlanta:Hockey Hell. Lord Stan's a Uniondale Man!  GO ISLES! JSM.

Well, suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while she was pregnant? Suppose your husband gave you some SDT (this recently happened to a close friend of my wife and mine)? OFTEN, the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on innocent people. Several times in the OT, this is pointed out, even saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person's sin for several generations. Even today, we see multi-generational (to coin a phrase) effects from alcoholism, child abuse, and spousal abuse just to name three. So, God's definition of fair and ours differ. Some points of perspective: Though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see Webster's first definition of inbred) thanks to Adam, it is arrogant and foolish for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in their shoes. I know myself pretty well, and I'm just not that good. Take God's word for it, neither are you. "There is no one righteous..." More important, when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus, God promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self's sinful tendency. We can, of course, choose to ignore this help.

: When Elizabeth greeted Mary, Elizabeth said something to the effect that : Mary, out of all women, was blessed.  If so, it appears that this : exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity. The phrase is "eulogemene su en gunaixin"- "blessed are you among women." There is nothing to indicate that this is an exceptional or unique status, only that _as a woman_ Mary was blessed.  Adding the word "all" is not a fair reading of the text.  There are some good reasons for the church's veneration of Mary, but they cannot depend on this verse.

(Although I've already tried >many of the non-pharmacological solutions) Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions, relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual hangover or "drugged" feeling the next morning. --  Steve Dyer

  >>Homosexual Christians have indeed "checked out" these verses.  Some of >>them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations. >>Others simply do not address the issues. >I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues,  There are exactly ZERO verses that "clearly" address the issues. >however, a couple of them seem as though they do not require "incredibly  >perverse interpretations" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality. The kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape.  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us. >"... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers,  >nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards,  >nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were  >some of you..."  I Cor. 6:9-11. The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_ in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of activity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or "reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all "clear" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions, with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated Christian discussion of ALL these areas. Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly "harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -- that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?] 	"'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything 	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one 	will not let anything make free with me."  [1 Cor. 6:12] Which is a restatement that we must have no other "god" before God.  A commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior. It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers. I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially. Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and which ones are "ritual."  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep). And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus from the "ritual law" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us. I'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this matter) about how "repulsive" and "unnatural" our acts are -- and what do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating insects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part of the ritual law? For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can be "law" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about) it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to determine why you "pick" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the whole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: "No doubt I am free to do anything." But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this, the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go through Leviticus and decide each "command" there on that basis, then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this context, it is remarkably offensive to say: >I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the >verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse. Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously (though one can always find jokers) in "defense" of bestiality.  It is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do* raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not mine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so. Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length, the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ- ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues. Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is. Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ. WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor? God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do. Why, for God's sake? 	"For God did not send the Son into the world 	to condemn the world, 	but that the world might be saved through him. 	Whoever believes in him is not condemned, 	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned 	for refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son. 	Now the judgment is this: 	the light has come into the world, 	but men have preferred darkness to light 	because their deeds were evil. 	For everyone who practices wickedness 	hates the light, 	and does not come near the light 	for fear his deeds will be exposed. 	But he who acts in truth 	comes into the light, 	so that it may be sh0own 	that his deeds are done in God."	John 3:17-21 For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified. However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity; and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us. --  Michael L.

During a minor leaque game a player neck was  cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes  flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since  his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the  usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck.

Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins is the one who will die.  The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." Is Ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps?

Okay, the earth has a magnetic field (unless someone missed something?) Okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty.. Now the question. Can you use electricity to power a space/low earth orbit vehicle? and i fyou can, can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power it?? Can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the electrical field? After all the dragless satellite is (I might be wrong), a suspended between to pilons, the the pilons compensate for drag.. I think I know what I want to say, just not sure how to say it.. A dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator. == Sorry for spelling, have not brought windows 3.1 online with my modem and comm program. YET!! almos tthere..

Though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies  falsely, it is still possible for the one who has prophecied falsely to prophecy truely again.  Take, for example the story in Kings about the man of God from Judah who came to israel and prophecied against a king. The Lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home. Another prophet wanted this man of God to stay in his house, so he prophecied falsely that the Lord wanted the man of God to stay in his  house.  While they ate and drank in his house, the Lord gave the prophet who lied a word that the man of God would die from breaking the word of the Lord.  It came to pass. Link Hudson.

: Ok, what's more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity? : Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex : completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, : to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong, : etc?  If not, why not?  Heterosexuals abstain all the time. : (It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders : to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life) The difference is that straight members are given the choice of abstaining or not, and celibacy is recognized as a gift, given only to some.  Gays are told that, as a condition of acceptance, they _must_ be celibate.  I don't believe that God gives me a forced choice between having a relationship with God and expressing my heterosexuality (within the context of a faithful relationship).  Nor do I believe that God gives that forced choice to gays.  Sex or Christianity is a false dichotomy. : To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII : starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is : this a myth).  Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are : Christian. For my part, gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches either because they were not allowed at all in the white churches, or, at best, only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members.

There is no reason to believe that Paul's thorn in the flesh was  a sin in his life.  That makes little sense in the light of Paul' writings taken in totality.  He writes of how he presses for the mark, and keeps his body submitted.  No doubt Paul had to struggle with the flesh just like every Christian.  Paul does associate his  thorn with a Satanic messenger, and with physical infirmities and tribulation, but not with a sin in his life. Link Hudson.

Organization: "Intergraph Electronics, Mountain View, CA" Folks, It's time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging  at my gut.  The list will probably grow.  1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that      the BATF obtained? 2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition      could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a "no-knock"      raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the       complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without       a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock       on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant       in a manner prescribed by law? 3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents      were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.      In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building      known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.      Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an      alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to      the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening      fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building?  4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that      David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over      $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the      members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms      License, were they actively participating in the legal business      of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the      weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence      consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally      dispossessed weapons. 5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,      a BATF spokeswoman stated "We were outgunned!".  Yet, TV newscasts      of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents      armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the      video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's      bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)      of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the       scene of the original assault on the complex? 6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the      complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a "hostage"      situation?  7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use "psychological warfare"      techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and      other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any       normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the       complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind? 8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex      were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable      to expect these mothers would have their children taken away      from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers      to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities? 9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch      Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members      who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an       armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a       lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident       does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the       fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.        Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle       penetrated? 10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and      the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,      bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas      within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any      known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI      have that a mass suicide pact existed? 11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on      the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition      and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be      more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas      or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence       found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition       and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,      and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were       engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the      amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect      for someone engaged in such a legal business? 12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical      news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to      crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is       there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will       be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act? 13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the      complex, "over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles."  On the video      tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles      engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one      would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no       indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,      buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be       evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.        Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter,       sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be       apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do       any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas       into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by       shots from high-power rifles? 14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United      States has signed international treaties which prevent the use      of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use      CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally      acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land? 15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered      in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had      been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county      coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet      wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within      the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head? --  ************************************************************** * Senior Customer Engineer                                   * * Intergraph Electronics                                     * * 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 * * Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 * **************************************************************

Med. on the  topic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a  very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving  that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in  pointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better  progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their  techingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation  to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or  better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just  the woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA  editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove  itself to the medical community. I'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which  has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support  nutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal,  that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and  manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing  only drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs  during his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a  better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being  worse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body,  he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his  students in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17. Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he  used diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic  Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to  speak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little  understanding of how diet affects human health.  This has to change.

Ken: Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big Boys if you're tackling Henry.  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in on the subject of staggering operational costs, too.  Good luck, son. >Shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences >and medical related packages.   Ahem.  The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be Politically Correct to contend so. >I am hopeful that DC-X,  or whatever the follow-on is eventually called,  >will perform as you state.  But right now, I must admit that I am more  >skeptical than ever.   It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come, to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.   There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-: DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental "X-plane" hardware. It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or building the DC-Y. I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If the DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a prospect too depressing to bear. (Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for small payloads.) I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some of them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line. >You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove the following: [...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...] >3  that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable >DC-X successor Strawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please.  The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations, as well as the "bird in the hand" argument your common sense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the Shuttle, not instead of it. Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated. >4  Most importantly, that the DC-X will open up LEO to more scientific and >technical payloads. If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M, rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites instead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of begging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a big difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?

And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you was believed. Things to note from this passage.  Unbelievers are both those who openly reject the gospel, and those who do not know God.  The eternal destruction is the same as the eternal hope in 2:16.  This distructions primarily emphasize that it is separation from the presence of God.  THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent while 2:1 is speaking of the rapture.  Don't confuse the two.  > >In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of >hell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. Yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven.  For instance, >it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can >continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or >whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is >burned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a >physical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive, >at some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is >no longer sensed.  If this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to ignite. However, there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning bush that was not consumed.  Also, the Daniel acct. shows that the laws of nature can be interupted even with earthly fire. >It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement, >the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell Maybe you don't understand.  There will be those who are alive at the end of the millenium, who will walk straight into the GWTJ.  Even those who have died in their sin will be resurrected, i.e. reunited with their physical body, to receive condemnation. >i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical pain. This is contrary to the teaching of Scripture. > What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are >to be forever without God.  >  >The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener >think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people >won't listen to God even after he rises from the dead.  THis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the "no physical body" thesis. >The point of >the parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening >to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ. >It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is >not even remotely pleasant. The true awlfulness of hell, is that it is eternal separation from God, after having seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ.  But whether it was open rebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known GOd (not saught Him as He is), then as Paul says, they are without excuss and that every mouth will be stopped.  There will be no defense at the judgment seat of God. THerefore we understand "it is appointed unto man once to die, and then comes judgment" literally.   just because it is horrific, doesn't make it less of a reality.   it should compel those of us who have the riches of Christ to share it with others --Rex

My feeling on baptism is this:  parents baptize their baby so that the 	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original 	sin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death. 	 	That is, the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young 	to speak on its own.  This should not surprise anyone:  don't parents 	*always* do what they believe is the best for their baby?  Why would 	that apply to the baby's physical needs only but not his/her spiritual 	needs to have God's grace? 	 	The purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to  	decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her 	parents made at baptism.  That is where accepting Jesus into your 	heart comes in.  In baptism, the parents ask Jesus to come into their 	baby's heart; at confirmation the child repeats that request  	independently. 	 	(By the way, these are my personal feelings, though I believe they are 	pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the Catholic Church on 	this issue.  Can anyone out there back me up or correct me?

It released >all churches from the use of the Latin Mass (unity) to allow them to >speak to the people in the common language (diversity).  In Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one congregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in each city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they formed something of a stew, with different members having different heritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together, sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups in places such as the temple courts. Now in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a common language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin was spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common language and not necessarily Latin. Naturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language.  In the first century church, there were probably many people in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don't see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called Pentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though -- bi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member - sometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet together on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don't speak English from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue.  Neat idea, huh? Now, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays, so sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish- speaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those meetings. As for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch with their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities.   >Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action? The action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of Latin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article. However, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted. I'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping. >Rather I believe it has been enhanced, for Paul exhorts us to become as >one of them that we might reach them. Thus, if a person or group of >people feel more comfortable "among their own", shall we not give them a >place where they can feel comfortable [with their heritage] and still >l[ove God?] {[my guess - Aaron]} You have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't.  Yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality "Christian" friendships outside your nationality (and your denomination). We shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples. >This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite.  It sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going about things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist Episcopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before. I understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it's hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to make it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity, would be taking the word "African" out of your denomination's name.  Then perhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the "Methodist Episcopal" part also, and simply be part of "the Church". >With regard to inclusivity, I note tht your .sig emits from MIT.

There shall be one church, for the sake of unity, AND it shall be useful in helping students new to America make the transition in culture, language, and thought.  We shouldn't make a new denomination to try to solve problems.  The whole denominational mindset only causes more problems, sadly.   >In the AME church, we retain African cutlure at the root of our >expression, but we are by no means exclusive. Since you live in >Cambridge, I invite you to visit the local assembly there: Thank you for the invitation.  That shows me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural heritage.  Thank you also for responding to my post.  I know (all too well) how they can be very time-consuming. The whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions, but I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time.  My own church, the Boston church, has the acapella singing that you mentioned in your post, yet doesn't limit expression of my Mexican culture, even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish (speaking) Zone.  I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the Sunday services of my church, because I know that my brothers and sisters here are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples. I don't believe in tongues, as you may have already picked up on, because of my understanding of Biblical Christianity.  However, I am certainly willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn't interfere with my normal worship.  Since you also live in Cambridge, I also extend an invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like.  You can meet the MIT students at the Student Center (across from 77 Mass. Ave.) at 9AM on Sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after Wednesday night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day. My number is 225-7598, but will be 354-1357 in a few weeks from now and for the rest of the summer.  Our service normally last from 10AM to noon, but occasionally are later or earlier (1-3 times per year).   >Let us always strive to reach all with the gospel by any means necessary. >As we move from milk to meat, the petty things of the world that >temporally separate us will dissolve away, and we shall stand with our >naked realizations that God has shed His grace on all of us, His >delightful creation.

This may sound argumentative, but do the pro-homosexual crowd give the same support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships? If we do a little substitution above, we get: "although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to incestuous men and women, there certainly is a fairly larget percentage (in my experience) who are.  I am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous incestual relationship.  This in no way diminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very significant ministry with the Incest association of his community..." Do the same standards apply?  If not, why not?  And while we're in the ballpark, what about bestiality?  I can't recall offhand if there are any direct statements in the Bible regarding sex with animals; does that activity have more or less a sanction? Please avoid responses such as "you're taking this to extremes".  I would guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant Bible community views homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at large views incest. --  --------------------------------------------------------------------- "They came for the Davidians, but I did not speak up because  I was not a Davidian.

Opinions expressed are mine and do not represent those of Rockwell. --------------------------------------------------------------------- [ Obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by anything from murder to sleeping late.  That doesn't mean that the same people would accept those substitutions.  The question is whether the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to represent Christ's relationship to humanity.  This is at least *partly* an empirical question.   In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because over time they always seem to lead to trouble.  I think that's the case with slavery.  One can argue that in theory, if you follow Paul's guidelines, it's possible to have Christian slaveholders.  But in practice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusion that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and not abuse it.   The message you were responding to was asking you to look at the results from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality.  (Note: Christian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some extremist agenda).  You may not want to base your decision completely on that kind of observation, but I would argue that it's at least relevant.  You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't look at the Incest association, because in fact there is no such association.  If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at it too.  Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such examinations would necessarily come out the same way.  Part of why there aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that some of them do produce obviously bad results. --clh]

: > I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like. For example, is : >there a constant sensation of falling?  : Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first, : but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that : of sky diving. I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'll tell you about my first flight. At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold). At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay attention to physiology at that time. After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don't get sick on the thing.) I didn't think of it as a "constant sensation of falling" so much as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensations I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up. Jerry: : >And what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience?  Ron: : It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be : induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress. : Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more : prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental : part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is : up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay : pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is "above" the head of : the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of : motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to : see how to keep the number of occurances down. I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do, among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual aids.  The goal was to measure the victim's^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject's responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness symptoms.

Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast  we can get diffrent hockey games.     ******************************************************************************* **   ___  ____  ____  ____  ____  **                                         ** **  /    /   / /___/ /___/ /___/  **   Experience is what makes a person     ** ** /___ /___/ /___/ / \_  /   /   **   make new mistakes instead of old      ** **                                **   one.                                  ** **                                **                                         ** *******************************************************************************

Hmm... there must be two towns with the same name.  Kaliningrad, located just North of Moscow is correct.  It is the home of several Russian space enterprises, including NPO Energia, Krunichev, Fakel, and Tsniimach.  The main Russian manned spacecraft control facility is also located here.    Kaliningrad is easily reachable by auto from Moscow, and tours can be arranged.  Call ahead though, there are still armed military guards at many of these facilities -- who don't speak English, aren't well paid, and are rather bored.    It's a very popular destination with Western space industry types at the moment.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Wales Larrison                         Space Technology Investor --- Maximus 2.01wb

The Command Loss Timer is simply looking for a command, any command.  A "no-op" is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the big bit bucket in the sky.  "No-op" also get used as timekeepers to provide millisecond delays between command sequences (used on the thruster preps on GRO, er, Compton) and to verify command links at the beginning of TDRS events.  All in all, a rather useful command.  And, an intelligent FDC test on Galileo (the Command Loss Timer). (still looking for GRO data, even though I'm the wrong David)

I just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, where the consensus was that sumatriptan (Imitrex) has no advantages over DHE-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side effects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30). Besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal spray works?  DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has to be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but most neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.

Well, the Opel deal fell through... Now i'm looking at a Datsun 240Z for sale in our local buy&sell.  Any previous owners have any experience with these cars?  Besides looking for rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that I should watch out for? How about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc.  These cars look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato(sp?), which has to be one of the most beatiful cars ever made. What is the difference between 240Z, 260Z, 280Z?  The 280ZX is rather  unappealing IMHO, but the other cars are decent. Thanks again... Darren Gibbons

Andy Byler writes on the Biblical basis for the dogma of the Immaculate Conception:  +  I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and  + between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall  + crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.  + -Genesis 3.15  +  He who commits sin is of the devil ...    -1 John 3.8  +  Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with  + thee ...    -Luke 1.28 In the Hebrew of Genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine.  + HE shall crush your head, and you shall bruise HIS heel. The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar. Andrew stated that KECHARITOMENE means not just "full of grace" but "having a plenitude or perfection of grace." The word is used elsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians 1:6  + Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath  + GRACED us in his beloved Son. (Rheims-Douay translation) I cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies anything as strong as Andrew suggests, nor does the Ephesians passage suggest that the verb means "to preserve from any taint of original or actual sin from the first moment of existence." I should like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb, preferably not from s writer who is discussing Luke 1:28 at the moment.  Yours,  James Kiefer

   Enclosed is an advertisement for the Defending the Faith IV conference to be held at Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio) June 25-27.  I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again this year.  I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in apologetics.  There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers, fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday.    Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid is available if you need it.  Housing in residence halls (each of which has its own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double occupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made for you at the very nearby Holiday Inn.  I think it was $47 a night there for my single room.  Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner through Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast, respectively.    Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on US Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.  Greater Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from campus.    Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer.    Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine: Friday afternoon special: Reflections on C.S. Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper. Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the writings of C.S. Lewis.  In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis, and he has since edited 18 of Lewis' literary works for publication. Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving in Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988. ---------------- Friday evening, opening session: Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz.

Major Catholic doctrines are misunderstood and attacked.  Like never before, believers need to know the reasons behind the Catholic Church's teaching.  As our first pope urged: "Always be ready to give a defense for the hope that is within you" (I Peter 3:15).    Grab your notebooks and get ready for an unforgettable spiritual and intellectual weekend.  This year's conference will candidly confront the hardest questions and objections about the Catholic faith.  Deepen your understanding of Church teaching with _Scott_ and _Kimberly Hahn, Dr. Thomas Howard, Karl Keating, Dr. Alice von Hildebrand, Dr. Peter Kreeft,_ and _Fr. Ray Ryland_.    Cut throught the confusion and doubt, and be better equipped to give a defense for the hope that is within you.

Many different observations, including IRAS > and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures > can range from 40K to 150K. Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The "large" grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed. Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation. Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of "small" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed "average" temperature. A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust (Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane. To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background, and I believe that to be correct.)                          Dilution   Temp.   DT^4 Microwave background         1        2.7     53 Galactic dust              2E-5      25        8 Zodiacal dust (emission)   6E-8     280      369 Zodiacal dust (scattering) 3E-13   5500      275 Starlight                  1E-13   5500       92                                            -----                                              797 The fourth root of 797 is 5.3 K.  Outside the Solar system, the result would be 3.5 K.   I find these results surprising, especially the importance of Zodiacal dust, but I don't see any serious mistakes. --

This was all badly reported in the news.  There is no evidence that signs of life found in old rock predate putative planet-sterilizing events.  Rather, the argument was that if life arose shortly the last sterilizing event, then it must be easily formed.  The *inference* was that life originated before and was destroyed, but there was no evidence of that. However, even this argument is flawed.  It could well be that origin of life requires specific conditions (say, a certain composition of the atmosphere) that do not last for long.  So, perhaps life formed early only because it would have had no other chance to do so, not because it was likely that life would originate under those conditions. 	Paul F. Dietz
Like many others I too was watching the Caps/Isles game when the went to the baseball game.  I too was pissed.  How could they interupt such an important game.  I understand about contracts, but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games! Anyway,  us BLUES (and Hawks) fans got shafted worse!  While everyone in the U.S. and watched the game on ABC.  However those of us who live in the central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus(?) Telethon.  The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through HAWK VISION.  This game, had it been televised, would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area since 1980.  This television BULL*&%$ has got to stop.  We are not only being deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, but we are also being deprived of watching them on TV.  PEACE,  HAMMER  
I'm wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which I've been thinking about: What was the process used to divide the Bible into verses. I believe Jerome divided the New Testament, but I've never seen any discussion of *how* he did this. It seems rather arbitrary, as opposed to, for example, making each sentence a verse.

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost, and you don't want to clip off the panels each time. For the Gamma-Ray Observatory, one of the design requirements was that there be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs, explosive squibs, gas shocks, etc.) used for deployment.  This was partially so that everything could be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay, and partially for safety considerations.  (I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened.) Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to orbit of $3.95 per pound :-), everybody designed things for easy servicing. --

I went to a place called American Car Care Centers to check my car for A/C leak.  After "checking", I was told that there is a leak in the compressor seal.  At the end, in addition to the labor for the check, I was charged 12 dollars for a pound of freon, although they evacuated my A/C afterwards because of the leak.  First, is it fair for him to charge me for a pound of freon ($12 plus tax) ?  Second, what can I do about this if this is unfair ? -- Albert Wu.

The people involved in it have been building hardware rather than writing press releases.  This is not a high-manpower project; they don't *have* spare people sitting around. As I understand it, there has also been some feeling on the part of some of the project management that publicity was not a good idea.

Also, Jesus;s statements on hell can be treated as totally symbolic, allegorical or as parables, as was much of his other teaching.  There's more than enough hell here on earth that we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesn't mattter to me.  And the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift God offers.

About 2 months ago Rush was chortling over the fact that Reagan has stumped "special persecutor Walsh" with his croaking of "I don't remember" when asked about Ollie North. If Rush's criticism of Clinton were to be applied to Reagan and North...  Reagan would have been impeached while North was convicted (and overturned on a technicality). Gosh, Rush sure wants to have it both ways... Clinton MUST be held  responsible, but Reagan was clever by using the "amnesia defense". Maybe that's waht Clinton should say about campaign promises and such "Well, there you go again Rush...  but to tell the truth, I wasn't in the loop and I just don't remember."

Infrared astronomy   didn't really get started until something like 25 yrs. ago; it  didn't explode until IRAS in 1983.  Gamma-ray (and I think   X-ray) observations didn't really get started until the '70s.  I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in   general, and I know that extreme UV (short of 1000 Angstroms)  observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost   no history except a few observations on Skylab in the '70s.  Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only   had access to optical or radio instruments.  Now, with far more  instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has  resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of   total astronomical work. >Seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit >as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics >and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit >anyway. fc> That would be true, if adaptive optics worked well in the visable. fc> But take a look at the papers on the subject: They refer to anything fc> up to 100 microns as "visable".

> >I saw a printed up flyer that stated the person was a >"licensed herbologist and iridologist" >What are your opinions? >How much can you tell about a person's health by looking into their eyes? Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it). You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the Classic Example, but there are probably others. Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body. The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are: 1: How does it work? 2: What evidence is there? The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures. (Always beware the words "channel" and "energy" in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner.) The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive. The word "licensed" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be told that it means "(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist". BTW, the usual term is "herbalist".  Why use a different word? --  --------------------------------------------+---------------------------------- These ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is not for $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions
Recently an e-mail to me mentioned: (Technically, the messengers aren't even human so it *can't* be a case of "homosexuality" -- even of rape.) [...] The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of the Sodomites' "lust" for the "other flesh" of angels.  Again, application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of gay Christians is largeely specious. *** Are angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world). what are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse   at all.

Gaining entry into heaven cannot be done without first being cleansed by   the blood of Jesus.   Sin cannot dwell in heaven.  It is against the natural laws of God.   Being converted to christianity means being baptized by the Holy Spirit.   You cannot get to heaven by good works only.   Because of the union with the holy spirit, the man's behavior will change.

(Charley Wingate) writes: >Seeing as how _The_Two_Babylons_ has been brought up again, >  Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious. >--  >C. Wingate        Maybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislop's scholarship was accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere Institute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked out about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private libraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were highly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.   Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions do not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his conclusions are "spurious" is without merit.  He gave references to all his conclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to Hislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown even to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it was so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of seven hills? Also, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own conclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the docrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even have to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre.  Where did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two tails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the church of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so, why did the RCC chose regardless? Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the scriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information from all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of scholorship in that. Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no evidence supporting it.   --Rex
anyone else experiencing a similar problem? This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the clutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San  Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to non-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!! Seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates. Any comments out there?

Haugh II                  [ PGP 2.1 ] !'s: ...!cs.utexas.edu!rpp386!jfh No firearms were ever ever shot at the National Guard at Kent State. At the time of the shooting, no rocks were being thrown at all.  The squad was slowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students were taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two students who were following and taunting. The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while occasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from. All at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1 Garands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this 45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with the taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in the confrontation. There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently they had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had conveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio, James Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known that he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in. The matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launched a civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the terms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not identified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified). It was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparently by General DelCorso or any of his command.  From studying the incident & the  photos, IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers.

I was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was exhausted.  My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called in the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery. AFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as I like to refer to him) said, "Well, I am off duty now." (still staring between my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was who was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty. The anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple of minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had left without even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only time  during my labor that I swore.  The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get there. Come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the next on-call got there.  Good thing for all of us (especially him) that it was not a critical emergency.  But boy would I love to knock that fellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a few little minutes. I have run into "Dr. Idiots", "Mechanic Idiots", "Clerk Idiots" and "Etc. Idiots" in my time, but this fellow I would like to have words with. Deantha

Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don't think so. If you take the view that the tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion. I don't know much about panda "thumbs", so I'll ask is it opposable? >>Thermodynamic considerations of surface/volume relationships would >>seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range >>similar to what we see about us. 6 inch tall intelligent aliens >>seem unlikely, as do those much larger than the elephant. > >Why can't a lemur or a brontosaurus* be intelligent? > >[*Yes, I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by >putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus, but so far >space aliens are also mythical.] Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I don't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say "intelligent" I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter  it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice for a putative technological alien. Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages  that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains. Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction. Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak. The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production  because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat.  I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity.

This one shouldn't even take you three guesses. Compared to the Second Amendment?  I think it's worse. The problem is, the devil is in the details.

Are there any loopholes here?  I'm no lawyer, I can't be sure.  I would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the Brady Bill, for example. The more words involved, the more details.

>new 300 series Mercedes Benz wagon... >Particularly, I would like to hear about power (manual t. only)... >Any comparisons between the Saab 9000 line and the Mercedes would be helpful. If a manual transmission is a "must have", then the M-B 300TE is not in the running.  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North America.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the distributors) are not interested in manual trannies. The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp. I have an '87 300E, with a "mere" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always nice, but I can't complain. I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions: 1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on. 2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel    drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously "hook" into    the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful    front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it    does not have this problem.) 3) Huge interior and cargo space. 4) The most "rubbery" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It    was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.    I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.    From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed    the car for an automatic. 5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does    not exhibit these characteristics.) You should also check out the new BMW 525 "touring".  This is a wagon version of the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs. -- Michael Chmilar

NO SURRENDER! Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993 It is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel threatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are immediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid of. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The stranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The mugger...the rapist.  And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door locked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and always, there's the implied question "what's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you? But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10 years to devote learning judo? What if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that "rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed - and were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any other form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for robbery/assault)(Kleck,123)  What if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a crime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the whole community. As a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice themselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves? Here's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says "no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110- pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out." But if a woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient means possible, people - especially other women - are horrified. "Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!" they ask. How could you hurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from you. In truth, 1% of "defensive gun uses" result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck) Well, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already made that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more guns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching others, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense. We're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT. But there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more secretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist. That menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that governments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed people. It's the way they survive. In our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and threatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next - what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides "it's for your own safety" or "we know best". Any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender. But this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who should be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt me? Then why did you file your income tax?  Like any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's really after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're after me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff, Metzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for our assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition.  As citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices given to women: to surrender or to fight.  Surrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the disappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender.  A battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if they have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson: "the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots." As a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will do my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write, and speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it can lead to Tiananmen Square.  When the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep them from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future, I intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick.  My opinions are, of course, my own.

Hi All I have a Korg DVP-1 for sale for $300.00 + shipping.  For those who've not had the pleasure: It is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice processor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change the notes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one time).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what you say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a "computerized" sounding singer, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes - you can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes - I'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input, it takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4" cables.  For output, you can have a combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has preset setups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a couple of light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when we don't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio. The manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten. --        oooooooo       o     o                      Steve Hitch      oo      o     oo    oo       My opinions are my own.

Marida Ignacio writes:    STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:    "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.    Blessed art thou amongst women".    Even Mary was confused about this greeting. There are various explanations for her reaction to the angel's greeting.  One is that she grasped what the angel was getting at, that she was to be the mother of the Messiah.  And knew what this entailed, all the suffering.  This gave her a moment's pause.

"mothership" except for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a "Grand Tour" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt  that the idea of a big "mother ship" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large "bus" spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond. The "bus" could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a relatively great distance. --- The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the "real" Voyagers, and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in addition two "sub-probes" could have been relased at Saturn, examining that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. A small "swarm" of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a  small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy,  well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of course.  MARCU$     > == >

How do you (Mormons) reconcile > the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection > people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)? That's the whole point, David.  As spirits separated from their bodies and living in the spirit world, they cannot undergo the ordinance of marriage, just as they cannot be baptized, since there is no physical body to be baptized.  We perform these ordinances as proxies for them, in their behalf.  Thanks for asking.

To me, not existing is worse than existing no matter what, so I will modify this question to be: would I be a Christian if it made no eternal difference in my reward or punishment? I hope this is in the same spirit you want. I personally am very goal oriented. It is hard for me to do things that do not achieve some goal. However, to relate this to sports,  only after I learned to not care about the score did I become a good basketball player. I had to learn to go all out no matter the situation. Perhaps this lesson is relevent. After all, only if I can give up my life can I keep it, only if I am humble can I achieve glory. Only if I concentrate on living my life now the best I can will I be afforded life eternal. I think you have illuminated the true meaning of "saved by faith." But what is my answer? Right now I would remain a Christian. However, was that always my answer? That's the problem. Heaven and hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity. And I admit there are certain times when perhaps I bite my tongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day, i.e. I mentally trade present happiness for future happiness. I hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that than appropriate, but I am trying to be honest. (Scott A Mayo) writes: > Of course.

"What If" questions are > fun and entertaining, but probably fruitless.  I think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful. I guess it depends on how one views knowledge and learning. By stripping ideas to simple, straightforward, opposing concepts we can determine levels of importance. By analyzing the theoretically  absurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd. Chris Mussack
Which Western states have laws that charge sales tax on the difference between a new car's price and the trade-in's value?  I know California charges you on  the full value of the new vehicle regardless of trade-in. If you are a California resident, is it legal to buy a car in a state other than California without also paying California sales tax?  How does California  enforce any law that requires you to also pay California sales tax (on top of  the out-of-state tax)? --

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital because of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do a lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite. I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT lab had been very unpleasant to her. To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may have a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put into this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation. Is there anything I can do about these pigs ? I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative. But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help sick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior. Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the people who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that sort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shit. Also, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out that neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at NCMH.

I think "The Yeast Connection" is > a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well > nutrition is taught, anyway? Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read  "The Yeast Connection".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing  by this "hated" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me? Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition. A book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida species  colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly  thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.   Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic  mycosis."  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic  infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or  "sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent  parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute  it. What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic  infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial  competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida  blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: "However, some factors, such as  the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to  both mucosal and systemic infections".  I was addressing mucosal infections (I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers  this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure".  I guess that  your nutrition course does not, too bad.   >>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  >>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible >>for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  >>yeast-like fungus.   >  > Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast > was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the > mold form.

(shudder) > Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying? My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you  noticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist. Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point  out, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells,  pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist  and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of  Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me. You know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small  little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in  Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too. I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what  I've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into  "The Yeast Connection" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain  and simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never  written. Marty B.

I'd assume easier, >since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting >gasses.  Let's hear people's opinions... The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of: 1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged. 2. All use an "aftercooler", which cools the air which was heated    by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI). 3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air    intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is    low. No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free. Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output  and mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power, and these are approved by the CARB. Dan Hepner

>this came from.  Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source >of the figure 10 percent. There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another figure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99% that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior. How many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many people have lied or sinned in other ways? >But in all fairness, the "shameless" nature of their acts is a >reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a >specific feature of homosexuality. Why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes "men with men working that which is unseemly" to describe the acts.   Sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of  man's not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their acts were shameless. >homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the >other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the >subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality >in passing. Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament? Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also protects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways.   I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.   If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, then those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.   If homosexuality were "natural" (whatever that means) wholesome,  endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of it in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that this was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty crime!   Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at I Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in  Leviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides this one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife.   Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan  coustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It was just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or not. >One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds >of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality >only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was >wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act >"straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying >to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian >ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the >relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's >judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make >judgements on these questions. One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin, like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse. God is greater than all of it.  Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many  people have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed. That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not God's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that uses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other sin. >I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is >not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's >tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating >holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues >to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to >avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. >For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat >meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about >which they had personal qualms.  I don't see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul's dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols. Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with eating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others.   But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough.  Paul wrote to "make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof."  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others. Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.   Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approach on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should  sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual "marriage") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered  a more damaging sin. >For another example, Paul obviously >would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) >remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly >would rather see them married than in a state where they might be >tempted to fornication. Yet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something that God ordains, and Paul recognizes this. > Note that in the >creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This >doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved. Actually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell. After he fell he would have to toil over the ground. >The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often >fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from >psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when >attempts at living as a heterosexual fail. That is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious position to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just like anyone else. >but I can well imagine Paul >preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian >relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis >suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such >relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love >with each other. I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this  conclusion.  It's like saying, "How should I kill myself, with gun or aresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat, or all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts? Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?   In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher the chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with  physical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all  leads to spiritual death. >Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their >relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul >would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of >argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors. The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the actual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having "loving relationships?"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual "love." (btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also, where do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly not explicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.) Link Hudson. [I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  Our basic concepts of the intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different.  As I indicated in the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and I still think they are significant), it does seem clear that Paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  What you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the Bible.  I'm afraid that communication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is even harder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent.  Since you disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions. Sometimes discussion is still useful.  I've seen some very interesting work on Paul done by Jews.  Obviously they don't agree with him, but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  But I don't see much sign for hope here.  In talk.religion.misc there's an axiom that by the time Hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensible discussion is gone.  On this subject, when sleeping with goats is invoked, I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be worth pursuing.  --clh]

Therefore it implies no such thing about the feminine in general.    Also Jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was announced "out of the blue."  This also is incorrect, as dogma is only the formulation of what has always been part of Tradition.  This dogma has always been believed, but was not formally defined until the Assumption was declared as an _ex cathedra_ statement. -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University

My father told me when he was growing up Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced. There are a few verses prohibitting divorce.  Somehow, divorce became acceptable (even in Catholicism anullments).  Certainly it is no longer a sin to associate with a divorced person.  The point is that each person has their own temptations to deal with.  Paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows.  Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not "compatible" with Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?  The Bible warns us against judging, greed, anxiety, impure thoughts, bearing grudges, etc., etc.  I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christians who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them.  All those who have given in to greed, get 'em outta here.  Jesus pointed out that he was the physician for the sinners.  Any attempts to make homosexuals feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible with Christianity.  Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to Jesus, we need to keep them away.  Does Jesus need us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin.  Do we really mistrust  Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin? Think about it.  Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and the Pharisees.  The sinners he embraced and forgave.  The Pharisees, hypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins and did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins.  What I take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins, those sins will not be forgiven.  And since those guilty of even one sin are guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of others are guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others of. The poor in spirit, meek, humble, merciful, pure of heart, peacemakers,  those who thirst for justice, those who suffer for His sake are blessed. Joe Moore

They need to be  discussed in detail, indeed. But for the purposes of this newsgroup  and thread  thus far and in this newsgroup, I risked oversimpli- fication.  My main purpose was to emphasize that I was not coming from a Buddhist or Hindu point of view.  As you observed, the main context is that of Christianity.  But by all means, add comments and corrections as you find them. I wrote a longer reply addressing some of your points, but decided to not post it. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for soc.religion. eastern. Instead I just add the following couple of items about karma  and reincarnation as I see the matter from an anthroposophical and  a Christian point of view. 1. Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a "judging    deity". 2. Reincarnation is not the same as being born again. 3. Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body. 4. Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings    of Christianity about God, the fall, the being. incarnation, death,    and resurrection of Christ, his coming again, sin, grace, forgiveness,     salvation, and the last judgement. >Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation >among Christian thinkers?  What were his views, and how did he relate them >to the Christian scriptures? > >Jack Carroll Origen's work was mostly lost. He was not anathematized, to my knowledge,  but his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies. Perhaps someone else can comment on Origen.  I don't know if there is a specific statement about reincarnation from him, but from what I do know about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another. I don't know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in the Church. However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II from an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes to go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he can relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance, an anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and Anthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was an actor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner and based his acting and directing methods on Steiner's indications.  Part of the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well, going to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another Polish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about Anthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask him what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said,  "Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in  reincarnation," and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times to modern times.  Then he changed the subject. My Polish friend did not say whether Origen was among those he mentioned. [As far as I know Origen himself was not anathematized.  He was controversial, but avoided outright condemnation during his lifetime. However some of his views were condemned at a Council in Alexandria in 400 and two councils in Constantinople in 543 and 553.  I am fairly sure the preexistence of souls is one of the doctrines condemned. --clh]
Could some please refer me to someone who can perform PRK (Photo Refractive  Keratostomy) in Canada (preferably eastern portion).  I've looked in the yellow pages with little success, and if someone has had a good (or bad, for that matter) experience, that would be especially helpful if you could please let me know.

>More than someone who would not release children from the compound. I suppose it's too late now, but the repeated use of the word "release" is peculiar.  Let's say you and your family are besieged in your home by some people with tanks, helicopters, and automatic weapons.  They give you a break from the amplified sounds of dying rabbits to blare, "You in there!  Release the children, and they'll be perfectly all right."  Stipulate on top of that that you may not have your epistemology entirely in order.  Is it entirely surprising that the Branch Davidians were reluctant to "release" their children into FBI custody?

What a load of crap ! The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire 	upon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were at 	first, then they should have surrendered immediately when they 	did realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies 	do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey 	or what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us, 	they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal 	wants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad. 	If they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply 	for the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant 	then they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get 	to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend 	that our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction 	within their borders. You live on US territory, you live by 	US laws - period. (unless you are a congressman) 	Sure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and 	the FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and 	his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco. 	The BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a 	propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big 	commando-style assault is proof of that. They should be 	roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the 	other hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did. 	Once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and 	finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that 	take root.  	The FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again, 	the laws we voters have approved, or the lawmakers who created 	them, gave them the right to do what they did. If BATF and 	the FBI are latter-day Gestapo, it is because the voters have 	allowed them to become that way. Waco was pure Americana - 	militarist mentality, religious fanaticism and unadulterated 	violence all rolled into one experience. We get what we pay 	for, or vote for, and this was the result of many choices 	we have made over the years. Don't blame 'them' - blame  	ourselves. We made 'them', we ARE 'them'.

The point that I'll try to make is that coincidences like this occur with a very high frequency.  How many of us have been thinking of someone and had that person call?  Much of the whole psychic phenomenon is easily explicable by this - one forgets the misses.  Consider your astrological forcast in the newspaper.  How many times have you said "That's me" vs "That's not me"?  You'll remember the hits, but the misses will be much more frequent. >	Maybe this doesn't hit you as miraculous. But to me it really >is.

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision of newborn males on the population. Since your friend is not a man, she can't imagine what it's like to have a penis, much less a foreskin. I guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every male, then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in appearance... The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be going to school on a South Pacific island. Tell her to check the Journal or Urology for circumcision articles. I remember at least 1 on an old Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean, if the cancer risk was that great, the Europe who have been circumcising like crazy, too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like mastubation. So you have surgical intervention that is basically unnecessary.
Yeah, but I hate to follow them with the exhaust at ground level. Not all diesels are well maintained, either, it seems they run for so long that people keep them going long after the top end is worn out.

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's hard to digest anyway.  For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses  your middle. Be sure not to "suck in" your stomach when sitting, again it will put pressure on the digestive tract.  Try laying on your sides, back, and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive. Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby "turn" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months. When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous. Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young.  But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible.  Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble. Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby.

 I am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles. I have heard of the LE SE LSE SSE SSEI. Could someone tell me the differences are far as features or performance. I am also curious to know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. And how much less than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how much are they in demand this time of year. I have heard that the mid-spring early summer is the best time to buy. 			Neil Gandler
Without restating the thread going here..... Zoloft is a stimulating antidepressant. It is unfortunate that antidepressant therapy is trial and error, but if it is any help, there are a lot of people using the side effects of the many medications to help manage other conditions. Hang in there, maybe someday a "brain chemistry set" will be available and all the serotonin questions will have answers. Please, no flames........I have enough to deal with   :)

I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported on in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action is as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a  weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!) and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile  action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!) Repeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking gun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and I will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's  ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's practicality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45) IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER WILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not bother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a Bystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!) call the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on  the ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will use it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and that of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none came forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded with the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special purpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you fully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the Glaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court. (ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not  ricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often cross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with one shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court. Be as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were. Repeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the same questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see if your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification and weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your  politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are required in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to hold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one, contact the NRA.

Well, I only saw it start in one place.  A tank punched a hole in a wall, and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that a 30+ mph wind was blowing.  I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday, and fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made.  A terrible, negligent accident. >And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying >to get out of the compound? Maybe they couldn't.  I've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire, but it happens all the time. What if they were in sealed rooms, trying to avoid the gas, and didn't know about the fire until it surrounded them?  Remember the Israelis hiding in sealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gas-bearing Scuds? Cripes, Mark, are you REALLY a college student?

Wellllll....  They weren't murderous.  They'd never harmed or even threatened  anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons and hardware.  And as far as "evidence", what are you talking about?   Everything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get questioned in detail about it.  Maybe you and your Increased Beverage Access buddies, sitting around the bar slurring stuff like "they shoulda killed 'em all 51 days ago" don't feel that way, but then you're probably one of those people still saying about Klinton "Give the guy a chance, we don't even know what he's gonna do!

No problem, you don't have any questions that scare any of us.  Most of our minds are apparently more developed than yours.   The answer is:  *YES!*  In a f*cking heartbeat!   open, blissfully sucking up anything the Feds said if Bush were the president? What, no comeback?  (OK, go ahead, say it.

Not in such a great degree.  Bush broke one promise, maybe two (taxes/guns) and we held him accountable for it.  Of course, it took him the better part of 4 years to do it;  Slick's only been in office 101 days and he's broken lots of them.  Anddd...  I imagine he'll also be held accountable for that.

Nobody's claiming that it was anything but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally don't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up.  And as far as how they picked the Davidians, who knows?  Maybe they figured that nobody'd care about such a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas prairie. Maybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs during their religious services (which was the reason the Feds gave for the timing of the raid) rather than running into resistance.  Maybe they KNEW that the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are trying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing on the Crips and Bloods.  Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the case.  Of course, their reasoning doesn't matter, only what they did, and this time, people are just paying more attention to it. >And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader?

I've had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best det ector available. The point here is trust and reliability. I've been able to "tr ust" the Valentine more than any other detector I've owend. If the Valentine sa ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo re than likely to be a speed trap. With my other detectors, I've gotten so many  falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal. That directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost alwa ys better than less info. No matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br ain is usually smarter. So, if I'm going to make a decisio based on information  at hand, I want all the info I can get. Plus, if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, yo u'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think i t works okay. Although, I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem of one radar souce. Thomas
>Michael Siemon writes: >Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth.  (and grandly) another Christian witness, to be taken for what he can tell us.  He is one in the community of saints.  You seem to wish for a greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant thought than seems to me, from a historical perspective, to be valid. To be sure, Rome rejects (some significant aspects of) Protestant thought just as vehemently as Protestants reject (some significant aspects of) Roman thought.  Other than some peoplw who apparently try to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, there is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume. Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans, as well as  those between Rome and the Anglican communion (to which I belong) show very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological issues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity. Thus, for example, as you go on to say: >                                                        They should >remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I, Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as opposed to political) significance.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't.  You misread me if you think that my communion, at least, "throws out" the deuterocanonical books.  Nor do I think you should overstress the sense in which the more Reformed may do so. >Again, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the >unbelieving Jews, drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD, in countering the >Christian use of the Septuagint.                 ^^^^^ I seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here.  It verges on, and could be taken as, anti-Semitic in the worst sense.  The "unbelieving" Jews were, according to what I understand as a Christian, the chosen people of God, and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation. I think they have some say in the matter.  The Javneh meeting should not be over-interpreted.  A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ (I don't have more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily from the background of Christian (rather than specifically Jewish) scholarship suggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering question, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis of the scrolls that were kept in the Temple, and thereby "made the hands unclean" when used.  The list of "sacred books" that may be drawn up from Josephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book, if I rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh. All of this is not to "throw out" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way, is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not? :-)) -- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment does not do it justice. > >Andy Byler --  Michael L.

It should be noted that the US benefitted not only from German science and technology after WW2 but also from British science and technology. From the discovery and manufacture of penicillin to jet engines, swing wing aircraft, the hovercraft etc etc. all were shipped lock-stick-and-barel across the Atlantic. We still are suffering from this sort of thing because of some of the more parochial aspects of US procurement policy. Meiko, a British  parallel computer company, for example, has now moved most of its facilities to the US since that was the only way it could sell stuff over there.                                                                    --  ================================================================================ Dave Clements, Oxford University Astrophysics Department ================================================================================ ================================================================================

What sadist brought up this vein about Malarchuk?  When I saw what happened I wanted to throw up, and at the same time I was devastated, since I thought that Malarchuk wouldn't survive.  BTW, I believe he picked up an alcohol problem after (before?) the incident. To radically change the subject, the Caps must be having nightmares about the Isles in overtime in the playoffs.  Have they *ever* beaten the Islanders in a playoff OT game?  This is lunacy.  The Caps are such a sorry team in the playoffs, they consistently choke against opponents who they should be beating.  Losing two OT games in a row is not coincidence, it's evidence of the choke factor. --     Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!      In this corner				LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!

Speaking of educational systems, I recently had a colleague tell me that the reason one of our fifth grade students is so physically developed is because she was sexually abused as a younger child. This, she went on to say, kicks the pituitary gland into action and causes puberty.
Until recently I always understood the term "kingdom theology" to mean the  theology of the kingdom of God, but now I have discovered that there is a  new and more specialized meaning. I gather that it is also called "Dominion  theology", and that it has to do with a belief that Christians must create a  theocratic form of government on earth before Christ will come again. I have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this, but I am told  that it is a very widespread belief in the USA. Can anyone give me any more information about it? Here are some of my questions: 1. Is it the teaching of any particular denomination? If so, which? 2. Where and when does it start? 3. Are there any particular publications that propagate it? 4. Are there any organizations that propagate it? ============================================================ Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial Department Univ. of South Africa, P.O.

There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly.  There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones.  There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists.  Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who.   Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon.  Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses aren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody.  Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the disease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have something that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been described yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out, sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment, sometimes they find it's incurable.   There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an  illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.  -Jackie-

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline  search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since  commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or  bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative. This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are  recommended rather than yogurt. I guess the next question is why would this introduction of "good" bacteria  back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the  anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a  facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and  colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain  the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion  was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the  intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida  looses it's major food source. Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is  normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal  yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has  been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in  the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting  their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their  patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if  ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age  emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the  medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to  help patients or does it look the other way. This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous  therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But  there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty  hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only  well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or  do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to  work yet? My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they  involve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into  the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other  is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a  problem with recurring yeast infections. Marty B.

You can't fight, so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system. Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't like it, but that's the way the league is going. By the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil game. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been a legal hit... After all, Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do things like that.)

For a reasonable sum, you can get a BMW with traction control: a torque-sensing (limited slip) rear differential.  Since no FWD car, including the Saab, has this kind of front differential, since it would exacerbate torque steer, a BMW with traction control should have the theoretical advantage on snow.  Of course weight distribution and skinny tires could affect this...

If so, then it's better to get rid of one good goalie and get a good forward in return.

That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia  recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.   Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work. > >Please note that I'm not defending light pollution.

We had a written quote which had been mailed to us from the salesman at one of these "no-haggle" Toyota dealers for a Camry XLE w/ABS, leather, etc.  The price seemed fair, but when we went in to take them up on their offer, they "discovered" that certain extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote. It would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do. Bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that the Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they don't have to deal.

All the clamor  over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical  trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against  cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective,  treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals  are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to  use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due  to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden  Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize  the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use  and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to  restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is  yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care  patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just  because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that  all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be  found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known  for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a  women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and  not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida  colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common  than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use. The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by  a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is  warrented. Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There  has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is  kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been  done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the  intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones  from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to  breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of  Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong,  increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is  restricting calcium intake. The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to  be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans  David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider  yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as  Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast  infections should decline. Marty B.

"Should any system of belief or practice to which people are 	committed be harmful or void of any benefit to society in the 	opinion of religious thought as defined in the previous paragraph, 	isolation of such from political and educational influence would 	constitute unreasonable censorship and an unlawful violation of 	civil rights."

	In the Boston area, you can hear the Rangers on WFAN and the Devils on WABC, the Whalers on WTIC and the Red Wings on WJR.

The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit loss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the Wings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team. The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his stick in somebody's eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I have seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an asshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call.

When they use the _same_ deconvolution  software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some  incredible results!  There is every reason to believe that the results will  _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.   Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works  realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.  You might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.  Starting on page 52 of the  April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product. It lists for $1,290.  The article states: "The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System  comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry  around."  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects, "it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter in the telescope's focal plane."  Now just imagine how well this infant  technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that  has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its development.

Several replies to my post have said that I should get to know   Christian homosexuals before judging them.  I maintain that I was not   judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong.   I would like to   look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical   evaluation of the people who responded to the side of Christianity   and homosexuality being compatible (admitedly not all are homosexuals   but I know that many are from their e-mail responces).  I don't   normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but   since I have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point I will. So far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because I don't   have the resources of others, and even reverted to name calling.  If   you don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you   who are homosexual Christians show me the diffrence. In Christ's Love, Bryan

Every so often, the Pope declares that some departed Christian is now in Heaven, and may be invoked in the public rites of the Church. It is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such declarations by the Pope are infallible. I see three possibilities:      1) The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death of (for example) Joan of Arc.      2) The Church was given a list before the death of St John which had Joan's name on it.      3) There is no public revelation about Joan, and Roman Catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, or even that she is a historical character.

Q. Should teenagers have the freedom to choose what church they go to? My friends teenage kids do not like to go to church. If left up to them they would sleep, but that's not an option. They complain that they have no friends that go there, yet don't attempt to make friends. They mention not respecting their Sunday school teacher, and usually find a way to miss Sunday school but do make it to the church service, (after their parents are thoroughly disgusted) I might add. A never ending battle? It can just ruin your whole day if you let it. Has anyone had this problem and how did it get resolved? f.

Oops - so much for the "meaning".

This week, many of you have asked about my earlier postings on OT, NT and Intertestiment exegesis on the homosexual issue.  I have refered you to the FAQ files, which I find out, no longer contains them.  They are too long for me to mail to each of you, each article, but will try to get them back on the FAQ file.   Because of the renewed interest on this subject, I will type, with permission, an article by James DeYoung.  I think it is one of the best articles that I've read todate from the conservative position.  I can't post it all at once, so it will come piece meal and not daily.  After I'm done retyping the entire article, I will make it available for the FAQ file.  Talk to clh. Also, for those who can't get through to me, you may try one of these:                               THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING                          OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS                          FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY                                       James B. DeYoung                                Professor of New Testament                          Western Conservative Baptist Seminary                                       Portland, Oregon      Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in 1 Cor 6:9 and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex, specifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the term's meaning to "active male prostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation, namely "homosexuals."  More recently the definition "homosexual" has been opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term "homosexuals" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals.  A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only factor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses.  Finally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline (I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).                       *************************************                                    INTRODUCTION      Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or sodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used twice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous scrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly,  the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.      This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence to point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the modern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the ministry.  Footnotes: _______________________  1.  For convenience sake, the term "homosexual" is used to encompass both same-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  The meaning of this term is one of the main considerations of this study.  2. These times are differnt from just over a century ago.  Then P Fairbairn (Pastoral Epistles [Edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it is a "term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent."  Unknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and study.  THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral Epistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive discussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship).  3. For example, see Scroggs' influence on M. Olson, "Untangling the Web," The Other Side (April 1984): 24-29.  For a study suggesting a further prohibition of homosexuality in the OT, see A. Phillips, "Unconvering the Father's Skirt," VT 30/1 (Jan, 1980) 38-43.  For a bibliography of other sources dealing with arsenokoitai, see the Wisondisc Religion Indexes (NY: H. Wison Co., 1987).

If you don't agree with Joseph's accurate statement of the Catholic dogma of Mary's perpetual sinlessness, then how do you interpret Luke 1:28, 	And when the angel had come to her, he said, "Hail, full of  	grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou among women." and Luke 1:48?  	...for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace, just as some of  us are, but it seems to me that "full of grace" means just what it says:    filled to the brim, incapable of containing more.  The only other people we  know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now  (another Catholic dogma, based on the communion of saints, as I explained in  an earlier post).  Full of grace to me means sinless, and anyone who has  ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary   was sinless.   As a Catholic, I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace.  But that's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play.  I pray God to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ, which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church.  And, as you probably know, faith in Christ's Church is tantamount to faith in Christ inasmuch as the Church is Christ's Mystical Body.  A Catholic by nature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ: (1) a personal faith in  Christ as his own personal redeemer and (2) a community faith in the Church  as the body of Christ.   --  Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock  Catechist [You might want to check the Greek.  "full of grace" translates a single word that simply means "favored", or perhaps more literally, "graced".  The "full" is a vestige of the specific translation you're using.  --clh]

Last year, I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an inguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have caused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people do, and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more painful and I had the repair operation. This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be another inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for another fun 8-) operation. I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38 years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling apart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger? Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting anything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days.  Is there some sort of exercise that will reduce the risk? Of course, my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at the computer, reading news... --  NASA/MSFC Flight Data Systems Branch

So what's : your point?  Is it OK. just because the people are nice? The point is not about being "nice."  "Nice" is not a christian virtue.  The point is that the gifts and fruits of the spirit (by their fruits you shall know them- Mt 7:20) are manifested by and among prayerful, spirit-filled GAY christians.  It was the manifestation of the spirit among the gentiles that convinced Peter (Acts 10) that his prejudice against them (based on scripture, I might add) was not in accordance with God's intentions. : I think the old saying " hate the sin and not the sinner" is : appropriate here.

: However greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no : way God or even part of God or equal to God.

Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to : any of the previously mentioned personages. As I said, it is a provocative thought. From "Answer to Job": 	The logical consistency of the papal declaration cannot be surpassed 	and it leaves Protestantism with the odium of being nothing but a 	_man's religion_ which allows no metaphysical representation of woman. 	...Protestantism has obviously not given sufficient attention to the 	signs of the times which point to the equality of women.  But this 	equality requires to be metaphysically anchored in the figure of a 	"divine" woman, the bride of Christ.  Just as the person of Christ 	cannot be replaced by an organization, so the bride cannot be re- 	placed by the Church.  The feminine, like the masculine, demands an 	equally personal representation. 		The dogmatizing of the Assumption does not, however, according 	to the dogmatic view, mean that Mary has attained the status of a 	goddess, although, as mistress of heaven...and mediatrix, she is  	functionally on a par with Christ, the king and mediator. At any 	rate, her position satisfies the need of the archetype. [par. 753-4] : Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology. Jung made it clear that he was talking about psychology, not theology.  His comments had to do with the psychological _image_ of God and its function in the human psyche, not about the actual existence or nature of God.
It is actually simple in principle. Porous adsorbents like zeolite and activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water or methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect.  Upon being heated, the  gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be condensed.  This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle.  The only problem is that the COP is very low (0.2 -0.6).   Max --  School of MPE, Nanyang Technological University |  Phone: (65) 7994818 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 2263			|  Fax:   (65) 7911859

>I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific  >brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them.  The principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in psychology called 'entrainment,' whereby external sensory stimuli influence gross electrical patterns of brain function. They are 'experimental' in that people experiment with them and they are _not_ widely (if at all) used in medicine for therapeutic purposes.   Given the exception of TENS and similar units used for external electrical  stimulation, usually for pain relief, not really a light and sound machine. They are _not_ experimental in the sense of a specific medical  category to that effect, as with experimental drugs, as the FDA does not  specifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.    >I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful, There are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects for mind machines, other than those relaxation-related effects found with  meditation or self-hypnosis as well.  Reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and subjective so far, so it's hard to generalize about their potential value. A pretty good general non-technical introduction to a wide variety of these devices may be found in "Would the Buddha Wear a Walkman ?" Some interesting background material, names of suppliers, and capsule reviews of specific equipment.   >do these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they induce >alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research if >any has been done on them? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer? >Or are they just another bit of quackery? A more important question might be whether they have enough additional value to be worth investing in.  'Biofeedback' was found to be a legitimate and reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions, (in that it demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previously  considered purely autonomic) but never panned out as a particularly valuable  therapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety and temporary nature of the effects in most cases.   Maybe someone else  has more, there used to be a whole mailing list devoted to mind machines, somewhere on the net. >Web Homer 						kind regards, 						todd +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Digital Equipment Corporation		             (215) 354-1273           | | Philadelphia, Pa.

>   >You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost, >and you don't want to clip off the panels each time. The "artist renderings" that I've seen of the HST reboost still have the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree angle to the Shuttle.  I think the rendering was conceived before the array replacemnet was approved, so I'm not sure if the current reboost will occur with the arrays deployed or not.

I would gladly spend twice the money for insurance, rather than using Geico.  Not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want to make radar detectors illegal.  They also ask if you have a detector (probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you). I know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that was not their fault.

This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list: I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said... Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid. Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to people like Koresh. Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US. There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas. Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they called local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the FBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force). "All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power." The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid illegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills disappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores. Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in chains. The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for review. Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had some medical personnel on hand. He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns back.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner. The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they audit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his followers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and they reacted accordingly. With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been completely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable, then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF breaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served warrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_ have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was the first shot fired! The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial position on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the public's sympathy. Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous, diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized, well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have even more tragic results.    - Lyn Bates PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston College Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time or place, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that information. -- 
I want to thank all the people that responded to my post a few weeks ago about buying an '86 Chev Nova with over 100,000 mi. I decided to buy the car and have had it for about a month. I replaced the front brake pads and changed the oil.  So far no problems have surfaced. I received many suggestions and encouragement on this purchase and figured a late "thank you" was better than none. Thanks to all! Jim
Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993. It was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, but it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I think it was also shown during the Calgary-LA game.  (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.) Topics ------ Don's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo, Wendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork. Episode Summary --------------- Once again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This was a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the characters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the Cat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc. Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs game. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players "They won in their building, we're going to win in ours". Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he got 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible for his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour from the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk resulting in a goal. On the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in the first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed however, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells the Leaf players "Don't let them score on you". won that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don thought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of instant replay. the series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr. Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his play. Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance during the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying that he can't play the way he should, because of the league's new rules. "This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its all hack and slash." Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the problems. Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings GM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray was shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination of fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article in which Murray makes the following statements: "Players don't fight because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator. Instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing each other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game." Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to "smarten up" with fighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights, someone gets cut every period. Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported by Murray. I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

But I wonder how that could happen : since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and : not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil. :  : Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed. :  : PS.  my initial question is "how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW" :  : Derek  There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights. It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try di it yourself.  You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset. Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doing it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you.  Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every 15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car.  I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil, air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils and done almost all of the other things req for service 1 and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights. After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad. Good luck!

Howdy All! I have recently converted to Microsoft Visual C++. I no longer want my Borland C++ 3.1 w/Application Frameworks product. This version is about 6 months old. I have all of the manuals, disks (5.25"), etc. It is licensed to me but I will transfer the license to the purchaser under the accepted terms of the Borland license agreement. I also have a copy of the books: "Developing Windows Applications with Borland C++ 3", James McCord, Sams (39.95) "Using Borland C++ 3 2nd ed", Mark & Lee Atkinson", Que  (29.95) I'd like to do is sell it all to the highest bidder under the conditions listed below. I'll ship C.O.D. to anywhere in the U.S. via the shipper of your choice (provided they are local to me), and I will pay the COD charges (you just pay for the shipping). The list price for the product is about $750. I have seen it advertised for as low as $500.  I will accept the best offer over $375 (plus shipping as described above) which is 1/2 the list price, plus, I'm tossing in the 2 books listed above (which are a $70 value). I will hold the bidding open through the weekend and close it sometime in the evening of 4/26/93. Please reply via eMail. Only serious offers please apply. No, I will not consider anything for trade, nor any offers less then $375 as I consider it a fair price.

Edgar Pearlstein asks (Fri 7 May 1993) whether the Supreme Court, or any other government authority, has attempted a legal definition of religion. The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1958 exempted from the draft those whose "religious training and belief" was opposed to participation in war in any form. It defined "R T & B" as "an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code." In the 1965 case of UNITED STATES V. SEEGER, the Supreme Court broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit theists. Justice Tom Clark, delivering the Court's opinion, said:    We have concluded that Congress, in using the expression "Supreme    Being" rather than the designation "God," .... the test of belief    "in a relation to a Superme Being" is whether a given belief that    is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its    possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God    of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such    beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective    holders we cannot say that one is "in a relation to a Supreme    Being" and the other is not...." My immediate reference is THE FIRST FREEDOM, by Nat Hentoff, (Delacorte 1980, Dell 1981).  Yours,  James Kiefer
: But waiiiiiit, isn't Nissan officially registering the car as far as : government paperwork goes, Nissan Stanza Altima, to avoid costly and : lengthy paperwork? I read this on the net a while ago, and someone : actually may have said there's a little Stanza logo on the Altima : somewhere. I just bought an Altima (and like it very much) and yes there is a little Stanza logo ever so discretely placed on the trunk. The Altima is emblazoned in big silver letters, but the itsy-bitsy Stanza is shunted to the far left of the trunk lid. You can only see it if you get up close to the car and know where to look. It is very inconspicuous. In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual called the car a Nissan Stanza Altima. Anybody know *why* Nissan did it this way? Mark Goldsworthy

There is a contradiction related to the moral issue of polygamy in the Mormon writings.  In the book in the book of Mormon called the book of  Jacob, Joseph Smith wrote that it was an abomination to God for  David and Solomon to have many wives.  Later, when Joseph Smith wrote the Doctrines and Covenants (possibly when polygamy was becoming an issue in his personal life) he wrote that it was not an abomination for David to have many wives.  How do Mormons answer this contradiction? Link Hudson.

Get a life and chill on the paranoia.   I am not a paranoid, nor a government toady, nor even am I the guy you were talking to originally, but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION.   A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not that wierd in Texas.  My own family, very quiet taxpayers with extremely con- ventional views, has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person home.  Some of them were mine, but I don't live there anymore.  I now have my own shotgun in my apartment.   Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no, I repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is saying that they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidence that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives.   It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup.   Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this) to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons.   I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever  bothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons, and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway.  If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then that is up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per- verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something in their state. semper fi, Jammer Jim Miller  Texas A&M University '89 and '91 ________________________________________________________________________________  I don't speak for UH, which is too bad, because they could use the help.

(You are given a small bottle of antigens; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) My allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. Throughout the treatment process I had to return to the doctor's office every month for re-testing and a new bottle of antigens. After the allergy was completely neutralized a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublingual drops are then taken 3 times per week), and costs $20. So the cost is less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home. Bruce Long

To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written, there is evidence of love, but that is a cultural bias. This is a poor answer which you needn't rebut. I will now pull the old bait and switch. I think you should use the Bible to judge man, not God. By that I mean, if your moral intuition doesn't like what is described in the Bible, realize that such things are going on now. I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil and ask what are you doing to fight it? Not you specifically, but everyone, including myself. If I don't like the genocide in the Bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now? To move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many people right now are suffering. If you think hell isn't fair and are willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence, what about how life isn't fair? Right now there is a young mother with three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through the day. Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie. Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to fix his TV. Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don't we help them. I think you are correct to challenge any Christian who doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess. You want evidence of God. Find someone who is making a difference, someone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times and has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask  the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the  woman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful business woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound baby. They won't all be Christians, or even what you might call religious, but there will be something in common. God is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what is in those people's hearts. It doesn't matter if you can't give intellectual assent to any description you've heard, they're all wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart  is a step in the right direction. Follow that instead. Then come back and read the Bible and you'll see that same thing described there. > > If nothing else makes sense, hang on to that idea, that God is love. >  > I would say something similar, but in reverse order: love >      is god.

The season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on, saying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS, USA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall. Come spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous spring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are). And everyone gets TNT now. So, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave hockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN in favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between channels every week. But, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy? --   their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburgh's.  Their  players are mighty bright, too.

I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents. What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths? I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a justification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.   >>More than anything, gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the >>community.

Overall, I thought that I had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were useful.     >>I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or >>brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135,000 youths) are >>obtained easily and quickly, through a personal friend, or more often >>"borrowed" from a parent without their knowledge. > >I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these "statistics" - I >suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of >students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun) >to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students >who carry a gun to school daily. >  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence or the Centers for Disease Control.  If YOU look carefully you will see that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that 400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once in 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access to guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between 1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the "statistics".       >>thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah (Got news >>for you folks, if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours >>presently, he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they >>were in danger). > >"Holding kids?"

If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such, why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive?

While watching the Penguins/Devils game last night, I saw the "slash" that Barrasso took on the neck.  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his jugular vein cut by a skate.  I think he was a Sabre, but I'm not positive. Does anyone remember/know his name?  What has happened to him since?  What about the player whose skate cut the goalie?  Name?  Info?  Has this ever happened before in a hockey game?    Thanks, Carol Go Pens!

I have a 90 Eagle Talon and I wanted a pair of GTS  Headlight covers.  Actually, they are turning signal covers since the Talons that year had pop-up lights. I went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light  blackouts for $45, but they did not have the turning signal covers in stock.  I asked how much it would be and he told me it would cost me another $40.  I thought this was a bit high for two small pieces of plastic. Can anyone find me a cheaper pair or even a used one?

I'm interested in this from the other angle: what antihistamine can I take at bedtime for relief of allergies, with the assurance that its sedative effect will have completely worn off by the next morning, but preferably with the anti-allergy effect lasting longer? I'm thinking mainly of OTC products. Which has the least duration of sedative action: Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, or what? Note that I'm asking about duration, not intensity. --  :-  Michael A.

continuing part #4 (I think); used by permission, THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY                                       James B. DeYoung W. Petersen      More recently Wright's understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic confusion in using the English word "homosexuals" as the meaning of arsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for rendering it by "homosexuals" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.      In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds "homosexuals" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  "A major disjunction" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in Paul's time (187-88).       What is this "disjunction"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic facts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts.  Virtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable.  Christianity simply added the categories of "natural" and "unnatural" in describing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of "homosexuals" and "heterosexuals," and assumed that, in the words of Dover quoted approvingly by Petersen, "everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . ." (188). [23]       In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term "homosexual" to desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term equivalent to "homosexual," used it as referring to orientation, impluse or affectional preference and having "nothing to do with sexual acts" (189).      Petersen then proceeds to cite the "Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary,"  which defines "homosexual" only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts.  Petersen's point is that by using "homosexuals" for arsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history "where no equivalent concept existed" (189).  Consequently the translation is inaccurate because it "includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes female homosexuals" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no "cognitive structure, either inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into 'homosexuals' and 'hetersosexuals' made sence" (189).      The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio "homosexual" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one mistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next phases of this paper will critically examine Petersen's position.                         THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING                           ARSENOKOITAI BY "HOMOSEXUALS" Historical Grounds      A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul's usage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to present-day concepts.        Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual condition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be part of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes;  Scroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under "Linguistic Grounds."      In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the homosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if it is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including ancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it.  Indeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of same-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex orientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in "Symposium" (189d-192d) may be a "sole possible exception" to ancient ingnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even here "acts appear to be the deciding factor."  However, this is a very significant exception, hardly worthy of being called "an exception," because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.      THe "Symposium" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile-female (androgynon ("man-woman"). Hence "original nature" palai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these human beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:     Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like     a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever     searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections     of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are      woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,     whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.     All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:     they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.     Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as      their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by     making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be     clasped in men's embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,     for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless     creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness     but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome     their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity     these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come     to man's estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in     wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of     custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.     A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the      willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when     one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort-      happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously      thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be      induced to leave each other's side for a single moment.  These are     they who continue together throughout life, though they could not     even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25] Should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as long as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each "would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time:  (192e).      Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is contemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  "Natural interest" (ton noun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination.  The words, "born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man:  (paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims "to be born this," i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity ("the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love," 192b) is present.  Aristophanes even speaks of "mutual love ingrained in mankind reassembling our early estate" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai tes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency ("These are they who continue together throughout life," 102c) is also present.  Further mention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, "gay pride," pederasty, homophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is recognizable.     Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from actions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is crucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b).  They mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow kinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its "desire" and "passion" (186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or "matters" of love (187c), the desires of love (192c) and being "males by nature" (193c).  Noteworthy is the speech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is related to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for "what is not provided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack."  This is the object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between "what sort of being is love" and the "works" of love (201e).  This ancient philosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]      In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not inclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter. [27]      Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In Rom 1:21-28 such phrases as "reasoning," "heart," "becoming foolish," "desires of the heart." and "reprobate mind" prove Paul's concern for disposition and inclination along with the "doing" or "working" of evil (also see vv. 29-32).  Even the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor 6:9-11) by words describing what people "are" or "were," not what they "do."  Habits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt. 23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise to the other (cf. Mt 5:27).      Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently was accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian, people of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a few moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example, Seneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an adult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women (The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he justifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange of clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).      Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the "new labels" of "natural" and "unnatural" for sexual behavior.  These did not begin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even non-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu, Plutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29] Linguistic Grounds footnotes ___________________________ 22  W.L. Petersen, "Can ARSENOKOITAI Be Translated by 'Homosexuals'? (I Cor 6:9; I Tim 1:10)"  VC 40 (1986): 187-91. 23 K.J. Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Cambridge, Harvard Univ, 1978) 1 n. 1. 24    We are conscious of the fact that Plato's writings may not reflect Athenian society, or that the speakers in "Symposium" may not reflect Plato's view.  However, it is assumed that they do, and with this agrees Dover (Homosexuality 12) and other evidence cited below  Harvard Univ, 1967) 141-143.  Note the reference to "adulteress."  If there is a homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes, logically there must also be an adulterous conditon derived from birth. 26 Elsewhere in the Symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love the male and young men (181c) but this must not be love for boys too young;  the latter should be outlawed (181d-e).  Such love of youths is to be permanent (181d), lifelong and abiding (184a).  Where homosexual love is considered a disgrace, such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the cowardice of the ruled (182d -an early charge of "homophobia"?).  In Athens it was "more honorable to love openly than in secret" (182d -an ancient expression of "coming out of the closet").  Mutality was present ("this compels lover and beloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue," 184b).     For Petersen to label the Symposium a "possible" exception to his position is inadequate and misrepresentative.  It is a significant witness to Greek society hundreds of years before the time of Christ. 27 Dover (Homosexuality 12, 60-68) finds homosexual desire and orientation in Plato's works (Symposioum and Phaedrus) and elsewhere.  Philo writes of those who "habituate themselves" to the practive of homosexual acts (The Special Laws 3.37-42; cf. De Vita Contemplativa 59-63).  Josephus says that homosexuality had become a fixed habit for some (Against Apion 2.273-75)  Clement of Alexandria on Matt. 19:12 writes the "some men, from birth, fhave a natural aversion to a woman; and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do well not to marry" (Miscellanies 3:1)  It is addressed in Novella 141 of Justinian's Codex of laws (it referes to those "who have been consumed by this disease" as in need of renouncing "there plague," as well as acts).  Pseudo Lucian (Erostes 48) and Achilles Tatius (Leucippe and Clitophon II.38) speak of it.  Finally Thucydides 2.45.2 has: "Great is you glory if you fall not below the standard which nature has set for your sex."      Boswell (Christianity 81-87) cites poets (Juvenal, Ovid), witers (Martial), statesmen (Cicero), and others who describe permanent, mutual homosexual relationships, even marriages.  Even emperors could be either gay-married (Nero) or exlusively gay (Hadrian), Boswell says.  Scroggs (Homosexuality 28, 32-34) admits that both inversion and perversion must have existed in the past.  He discusses possible references to adult mutual homosexual and lesbian relationships, but dismisses them (130-44). 28  See specifics in S.R. Driver A critical and Exegetical Commentary on Deuteronomy (Edinburgh:1895) 250.  He observes that the prohibition of cross-dressing in Deut. 22:5 is not a "mere rule of conventional propriety."  See also Dover, Homosexuality  73-76, 144. 29  Plato in his last work, in which he seeks to show how to have a virtuous citizen, condemned pederasty and marriage between men as "against nature" (para phosin)(Laws 636a-b;  636c;  836a-c; 838; 841d-e).  According to TEST.NAPH 3:4-5 the sodomites changed the "order of nature."  THe Jewish writers, Philo (On Abraham 135-137) and Josephus (Ant. 1.322; 3.261, 275; Ag. Ap. 2.199; 2.273, 275) label sexual deviation as "against nature."  Finally,, first century moralist such as Plutarch (Dianlogue on Love 751c-e; 752b-c) spoke of homosexuality as "against nature."  Christians clearly did not invent the labels "natural" and "unnatural".  See J.B. De Young, "The Meaning of 'Nature' in Romans 1 and Its Implications for Biblical Prosecriptions of Homosexual Behavior" JETS 31/4 (Dec 1988):429-41.

As to the last comment, I certainly realize that it was not intended to sound that way.  I am still trying to understand *how* a spiritual being colud truly be one and three at the same time.  All of the descriptions of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading (sort of, "they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways, but really they are one, trust me"). Neither of these is acceptible to me. The fact is, so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any *sense* to me are the modalistic ones, such as Modalistic Monarchianism or "Economic Trinitarianism".  [I can accept that the three aspects are intrinsic to the nature of God, so I perhaps lean more towards the latter]. I am trying, here, to see if anybody can come up with another description that is both orthodox and believable. --    or [I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox, to the extent that well-meaning people think they've just flat-out confused.  There's no problem with things being both 3 and 1, e.g.  if the 3 are different parts of the 1.  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit aren't exactly parts of God, because parts are things distinguished by physical separation.  All three Persons are omnipresent, so they are obviously aren't physically separate.  But they're in some way different aspects, modes, or whatever, of one God.  If you accept economic trinitarianism, it's possible that you don't have any substantive difference with the standard view.  Is it possible that you just don't find the neo-Platonic explanation illuminating? --clh]

Let's see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process. Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning. I could go on with these examples for a long time.... Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks, and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized,  imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be free from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was  good for them. I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority, is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. This is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people  by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have equal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and medical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of beauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right. Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people? The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail than you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away. Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole life, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live for?   I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both. I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living. That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.

>adults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents >can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of >the body as easily. The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but I can answer a few general points. Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even young people find the change unsettling. Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say - anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these patients early. Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us) generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to the individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult tasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted. Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life of the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow release formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing more it is hard to comment. Don Mackie - his opinions esiology will disavow...

Hello netters,    I'm new to this board and I thought this might be the best place for my post.  I have a question regarding satellite technology seen in the movie Patriot Games.  In the movies, the CIA utilizes its orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa. The photos taken by the sats are stunning!  I know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My question is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the British SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was watching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is, one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp. Does such techology exist and what is it's nature?  i.e., UV, IR, x-ray, etc. PS  Who wrote the book Patriot Games? Mad Vlad

I recently heard of some testing of a new migraine drug called sumatripton (I have no idea of the actual spelling) that supposedly utilizes a chemical that trips neuro-transmitters.  My mother has regular migraines and nothing seems to help - does anyone know anything about this new drug?  Is it in a testing phaze or anywhere near approval?  Does it seem to be working? Any information would help. Please feel free to e-mail rather than take up bandwidth if you prefer. Thanks in advance, -Rox --  "Virtue is a relative term."

Cap Cities are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service. The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks. Prime SportsChannel will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season. Also,TCI and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC and ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams. -PPV Mark
>	What evidence is there that there is a trend towards greater >species diversity over time? What I see going on right now is a major >extinction event, and  it isn't clear to me that the diversity 10K years >ago was necessarily greater than 600 million years ago. Well, there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of. The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase in animal diversity. Likewise, after the one-two punch of the Permian and Triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread  of humans. (**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction (*) about 800 families Also, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in succesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first, ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory when they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms (pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land.  (1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families) (2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families) (3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently) It's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this in the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions happen often enough to keep the total number down. (***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystems were.  See Cowen's book "History of Life" for a not-too-technical run-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life. Or see, Wilson's "Diversity of Life" for a view centered more on current ecology -- this is (IMHO) the best popular biology book of (what the hell, I'll say it) all time.  >							James Nicoll Follow-ups to t.o.

Well, I seem to have struck an  interesting discussion off.  Given that I am not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist,  i'll have to boil it down a bit. 1)  ALl the data on bursts to date,  shows a smooth random distribution. 2)  that means they aren't concentrated in  galactic cores, our or someone elses. 3) If the distribution is smooth,  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY large phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena 	OR we are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud,  but then it needs some potent little energy source,  that isn't detectable  by any other current methods. 4)  we know it's not real close,  like  slightly extra solar,  because we have no parallax measurements on the bursts. 5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string  impacts or something like that. So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile. what i am wondering,  is this in people's opinion,  A NEW Physics problem. Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect.    Copernicus,  started looking at  irregularities in planetary motion. Is this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics? just a little speculative thinking folks. pat
I hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net before, but I'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that "the assumption of Mary" would be better phrased "our assumptions _about_ Mary."  In all the time I've been reading about Mary on this group, I can not recall reading much about Mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, Scriptural foundation.   I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parents as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to God's working, beyond doubt.  But the almalga- mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human desire.  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even He knew temptation, albeit without submitting to it. I also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some- how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or- dinary human being.   I won't start yelling about how people are "worshipping" Mary, etc., since folks have told me otherwise about that, but I do think we lose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we make his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.    -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........   .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . .  .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .     .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .

This has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with. From a long article Available through an individual on this newsgroup. About scripture being against homosexuality: ------------------------------------------ When we  are less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian  people, engaging in loving, voluntary erotic relations with each other, aren't  even mentioned. [in the Bible, tk] ------------------------------------------ This frightens me (not in the homophobic sense, but intellectually), especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church. So, if my interpretation is different than theirs, I am homophobic!  This can't be right. Disagreement in interpretation of the Bible and/or rejection of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia. ====================================           University of Georgia, Athens Institute of Higher Ed.

But to think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then tell the Prez, who says, "I knew all along".  While this may not seem right, or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command leading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and maybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave. Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said are true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives should be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from reaching its full potential.

Hi, 	I'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermo- genics. The drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn food  creating eat as opposed to the fat being stored. There are all sorts of warnings about fevers, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, ect.. 	The silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does not  require a change in diet. Is this possible? Are the pills dangerous or just hoaxes? Karen

Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm team, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting?

What's worse, the SportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out, since we got CBA basketball last night, if you can believe it.

The differential arrival time techinique requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions.  The differential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 10's of nanoseconds. This is smaller than BATSE's microsecond timing capabilities. BATSE, Ulysses, and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique. Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view. The sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing  angle of incidence.  The burst position on the sky is determined by comparing the count rates in different detectors. Pat

You know, I'm a Ford fan, I must say, so I'm looking forward to the next Mustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable than the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.   The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality, just the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments; it's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they're getting better and making the move in the right direction. They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only in words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn't press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it. Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway. I do not put much stock in the mag rags' "inside" information, or even Ford rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it's entirety.  "Inside" information had the Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't look for a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself if you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a new car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been brewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those modular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and competition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do. And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there, who really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it. Highly. The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attracts way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritage is more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit that. I submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know, intelligent, critical spews like, "The Mustang bites, man!"  Some of you are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual. The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to the driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set. Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be no clear winner. Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believe that it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you? :^) Regards, Brian ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I am the engineer, I can choose K. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Department of Engineering Mechanics Ohio State University Columbus, OH

On Thursday 6 May 1993, Dave Davis writes:  > I'm leaning... SIRACH... is more directly referenced by JAMES  > than JOB or RUTH is... in any NT verse I've seen. It would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from SIRACH and from JAMES. Job 5:13 ("He taketh the wise in their craftiness") seems to be quoted in 1 Corinthians 3:19. James 5:11 ("You have heard of the patience of Job"), while not a quote, implies that James and his listeners are familiar with a story of a man named Job who exhibited exemplary patience. It is possible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew Bible, but rather another similar and related story. (One has the same problem with direct quotes.) Again, Matthew 1:5 ("Boaz begat Obed of Ruth") tells us that Matthew knew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz and  became the ancestor of David. Since Ruth is not mentioned in the OT outside the Book of Ruth, it seems likely that Matthew was familiar with the book and respected it, and thought Ruth important enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy. References like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his OT source inspired or inerrant or canonical. But neither do direct quotes.  Yours,  James Kiefer

My current car is a convertible. IMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top, sunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it.  There's no substitute for a convertible.  If you're not after that sun beating down on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the whooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'. So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't call it a convertible. And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll bar in a rollover situation.  Of course, I'd rather not test it in MY car.  I, too, am in my early 40s.

So far, the medical examiner (according to the news) has found NO EVIDENCE of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined.  If this continues to be the case, it will sort of shoot holes (pun intended) in the FBI story, wouldn't it?  And cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch a bullet like they do when fired from a gun.  The bullet hardly moves, it is the brass casing that goes flying, and then with less than lethal force.  It will hurt, yes, but not KILL you - I doubt if it wil penetrate a coat, for example. How about an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full subpoena powers, and powers to prosecute on felony charges, to investigate for any possible illegal/criminal activity on the part of both the BATF and FBI?  I cannot see any reason why not - to use the phrase they like to use so often, "if they have nothing to hide..." they should welcome it, and vigorously support it.

All opinions, benchmarks, >>>recommendations, etc. are welcome. The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I looked quite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as some other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are considering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we both think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort and performance were both significant. Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below. Mazda 626  + very comfortable and roomy  + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is    hard to find  + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:    tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat  - more expensive than many other cars listed below Honda Civic  + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here  + comfortable front seat  + adjustable seat belt mounting  - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof) Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla  - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)  + adjustable seat belt mounting  + can get ABS without lots of other extras Saturn  + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so  - motorized attack belts Dodge Spirit    no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok  - rear seat does not fold down Chevy Corsica  + comes with ABS standard  - lower "would you buy that car again" and safety ratings in    Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above)  - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +    for some) The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the 626, and in our minds, not significantly better. We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the "big 3", due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products, (b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts and no air bag. We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C and cassette advertised for just under $12800 (Washington Post, April 14, I think), and my local dealer says they can match that price.  I will probably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow).  The main question in my mind is whether or not I will have to do a "factory order" or "preference order" to get one with ABS, and whether or not the dealership will run the price up a lot if I do so.

>Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to >keep watch? ... There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However, there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large part of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like Galileo or Cassini. >How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things >around and near and on Pluto... It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion. >It could do some scanning of not only Pluto, but also of the solar system, >objects near and aaroundpluto, as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy >without having much of the solar system to worry about.. Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things that can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is *not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet. --

God's experience of time is so completely different from our own, since He is both within and without it.  Using words like "foreknowledge" and "predestination" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing God's perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and ending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no "before" when He did not know, so he could not have "foreknowledge" of our lives or a time when he could have "predestined" our actions.  In fact, since our understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our free will interacts with God's control of the universe.

Mike Adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight to the human being.  I love this topic, as some of you regulars know. So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk about it; I shall. I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent  as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and  probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort. I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media. A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to  compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition, ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration. Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition, we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls of NASA and industry. I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally eager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application to spaceflight. ken

It sounds like she has a problem.  She has a problem opening up to her husband so she is lesbian.  WHAT? In a marrige, a couple is supposed to open up to each other.  Because she didn't feel comfortable opening up to her husband she gets a divorce and comes to the conclusion that she is lesbian.  Before anyone gets maried they should make sure that they would feel comfortable "open up the deepest part of her soul to her husband".  "Sex, in her mind, is only a part of the whole relationship."  Did she think it was diffrent with a man. That might be her problem. In Christ's Love, Bryan
I decided to come back and amend this so it quotes me and has added comments... >>Hi, >>it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   >>no matter what position I was in.

Second, the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them. Third, your body, like most peoples, wasn't bred to live on a high fat, modern diet. If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about the luxury of eating fat, how people enjoyed it. This was because it was so rare. Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that they do now.   >For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta or >rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn.

If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the baby. (It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest of the population, a good part of it is that they are willing to do the dieting, etc that helps them avoid surgery.

>"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently,  >often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality... >but the context really isn't that important. My question is whether that >statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not. >Hate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed >since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not  >something is a sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the  >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so  >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate >the sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and  That is an assumption on your part.  Where is your proof that one always will degenerate into hating the sinner, because he hates the sin. I am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America.  It is true that many individuals hated the proponents of racism.  It is also true that many  individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it.  Dr. King's message was this.  Love the individual, the loving of the individual would transform him into a friend.  However, this did not take away his hatred for segregation.  His hatred for injustice.   >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our  >neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he  >commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians >supposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one >way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We >need to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love  >with theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to >love someone is to pray for them.  I would ask, "Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish Leaders of his day?"  Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers out of the temple? We must have at least a distase for sin.  We must in order to fight it in  ourselves.  Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its right name.  Jesus loved everyone, but he called sin by its right name. It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk, but it is also true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth. -- "Competition is the law of the jungle.  Cooperation is the law of civilization."  --  Eldridge Cleaver

Before you finalize your file in the FAQs (or after), you might want to  correct the typo in the following: > Kinsey (see below) is the source  > of the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by  > orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely  > heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual). It seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with  "homosexual". As a personal note, I guess I differ with you on the question of work  entering human life as a result of sin.   > Note that in the  > creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.   Before the fall (Gen 2:15) "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into  the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." which I would call "work".   For me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added  at the fall (I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the  work for sustenance).  In a way, some view "work" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes  is a fun book! - for melancholies). I hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further. Well, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what  you state as your purpose "It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian  homosexuality", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ. I wonder if you might temporize the apparent "sentence" of the specific  homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define). > The danger in advising Christians to > depend upon such a change is clear: When "conversion" doesn't happen, > which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling > excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement > of life-long celibacy.    Perhaps that would be true of "celibacy from homosexual relations", or  refrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid  heterosexual.  Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations "for what it  was worth"?   [This depends upon the person.  In some cases I think the answer is no.  Even with those who could, consider what you're asking.  I assume we're talking about marriage -- I certainly would not want to suggest sex outside that.  You're talking about a permanent commitment to a kind of sexual relationship that they aren't really sure they can live with.  There may be people for whom this is a possible solution, but I wonder whether it's entirely fair to the other partner.  I have a cousin who was a victim of exactly this situation.  We found out later (after her death) that her husband had had problems with his sexual identity.  His family (conservative Christians) knew it, and pushed him into getting married.  He continued having problems, and they were near divorce.  She died in an accident whose circumstances some of the relatives consider odd.  He has since had a sex change operation, and has been moving around from state to state without being able to hold a job, keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets of grandparents consider irresponsible.  I hope you can understand why I am not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage.  I really liked my cousin.  This is sort of an emotional issue for me.  Again, it may be possible for some, but this is the sort of situation that needs to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixed ideology.  --clh]

I'd buy that for two reasons.  The tubes for TV's and radios (if you can still find them) are usually 3x or more expensive than comparable transistors. Also, ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer, and they'll tell you tube-type, since tubes have lower distortion and noise than transistors.  'Course, most of your electric guitar types just say "Tubes sound better, dude." :-) Also, transistors have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use, mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes. -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\ As the radius of vision increases, -------------------------------------------------------------------------

As St. Augustine said, "I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy."  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)] Why is it fair to punish you, me and the rest of humanity because of what Adam and Eve did? Suppose your parents committed some crime before you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in jail for it. Would you really think that is fair? I know I wouldn't.
On Sunday 9 May 1993, Kenneth Engel writes (in substance):   We are told that the penalty for sin is an eternity in Hell.   We are told that Jesus paid the penalty, suffering in our stead.   But Jesus did not spend an eternity in Hell. This objection presupposes the "forensic substitution" theory of the Atonement. Not everyone who believes in the Atonement understands it in those terms.

	of Denver for the Denver community.  The University has neither 	control over nor responsibility for the opinions of users. The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start violence.   When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back. But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for their wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical attention that the BD were not looking for trouble.   If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening chips for medical attention etc.   A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking ATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day but they were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor.   All the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the BD.     -- Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substitute Boulder, CO                    | for brains is silence. satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      |

> My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but  got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering  the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO  inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive  of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out  of my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these  rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.)  Anyway, here are my thoughts on this:  I'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.   The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.  Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.  But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.   To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.  Regards,  Wm. Hathaway  Baltimore MD  (P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome,  just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know  that other people may not accept it without a complaint.)

How is it that placebos are legal?  It would seem to me that if, as a patient, you purchase a drug you've been prescribed and it's just sugar (or whatever), there's a few legal complications that arise: 	1.  If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted treatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice. 	2. A placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?) 	3. Getting what you pay for.  (Deceptive "bait and switch" to an extreme...).  False advertising  (what if McDonalds didn't put 100% pure beef in their hamburgers?) 	So I'm mystified.  Are these assumptions erred?

(Aaron Bryce Cardenas) writes:    Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For    Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith    comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word    of Christ."    So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the    gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids    are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to    respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot    be raised in baptism to a new life. Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that's one primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby's soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have without Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his intellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as the child gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.    Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the    guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The    righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the    wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."    If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty    for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam. Adam was given a number of gifts by God.  The chief among them was what Catholics call "sanctifying grace".  (In the New Testament, the word used for this is "charity".)  By his sin, Adam lost this grace. He didn't lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole human race.  Because once he lost it, he couldn't pass it on to his descendents. That's why Catholics baptize babies.  Through his Original Sin, Adam lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents.  Christ instituted Baptism to give it back to everyone. Babies are not being punished for anything they personally did; they are simply lacking in something they need, in order to enter Heaven.

His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs. It doesn't look like this trend will change with the Bruins. 2. Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in their entire 68-year history. It doesn't look like Buffalo will just lose their next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on his head. Basically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend. Also,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after an incredibly great start by the Red Sox(best record in their major leagues as of now). I would say that 70% of the callers to the Bruins' flagship station(SportsRadio 590) are talking about the Red Sox,about 15% are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft,10% are on the Celtics and about 5% are on the Bruins. Somehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding early. -PPV Mark

What about including points?  Probably no goals (at least against opponents) but there have been several assists given. --       Ian Neath        | There are four kinds of people in this world:
Let me return to the question, stipulating that Paul meant his use of _arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition of male-male sex.  In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I'll also stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the term for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would mean for Paul's readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter than my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us with some of the major divisions within Christ's body, and I am not trying to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that separate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely characterizable as "liberal") will be evident, but I am not grinding an axe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD to reach "closure" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we each, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ. So; stipulating Paul's intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS READERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is a second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him? Since Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st Corinthians, there are two "positive" answers and one "negative" to this question: +	a.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has 	    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem- 	    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be 	    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no 	    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence 	    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)] +	b.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul, 	    what God means "behind" Paul's inspired word-choice.) -	c.  We *don't* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre- 	    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul, 	    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ ("those who have 	    more" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is "obvious" from 	    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB 	    translates it as "grabbers") or even _methusoi_ ("drunkards" 	    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult, 	    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!) The three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards tradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical demand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses. _ad_ a:	It is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the 	community of Christ's disciples and their successors, and that 	our NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition. 	But it's also the case that we know little or nothing about this 	tradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that 	we have access to the tradition only after several generations of 	possibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only 	documentation of the tradition in the critical era. _ad_ b:	If we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an 	attempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under- 	standing the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of 	men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit 	from blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But 	the downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit 	as our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that 	takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent 	understanding supposedly derived from the "clear" Word of God. 		constrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even 		while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture; 		the more bizarre forms of "I will read Scripture my way" 		are primarily a fringe aspect of "cultic" Protestantism.] 	The main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no 	means for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel 	*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible 	conflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind 	"convinced" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously 	urge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian 	against Christian.  To what purpose? _ad_ c:	The critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can 	reach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open 	to all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually 	possible. :-) 	[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias; 	one complaint against critical methodology is that it "dissolves" 	faith -- but surely a "faith" that cannot honestly face the evalu- 	ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to 	address.] Anyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between "liberal" and "conservative" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that despite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I predict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position its due, but no more than its due.  Second question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of "spiritual" Christians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible, that Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against male-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi- bility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it's precisely where inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they're most dangerous. We have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of tradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them). We have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the traditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus and Peter and Paul do not so much "throw out" tradition as subject it to radical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:      "the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith" 							(Matthew 23:23) and  "On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,       and the Prophets, also." 							(Matthew 22:40) If there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the challenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation to go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts (vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus' reported words and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination to *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges against are in fact open to challenge. All traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may lead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual instruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and inherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is immune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy and good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from love of God and love of neighbor. I am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That the Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am too dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I *know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians appealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated "sodomites" as the "cause" of the earthquake, so that legislation was passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in accord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human tradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick to condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit, then I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord is that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians, for the truth that lives in the Body of Christ. And I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel said to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church: 	"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise, 	this movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of 	its own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not 	only be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves 	fighting against God." 							[Acts 5:36...39]  All I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures with a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our first Christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER readings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of Christians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of the Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who are NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God's truth. --  Michael L. Siemon		I say "You are gods, sons of the     - or -			you shall die like men, and fall [There's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to whether you're speaking of tradition in Paul's time or ours.  I think there are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and his readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition.  That's what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that Paul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex. Everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background. The tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with that background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren't the most general terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there's some evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of homosexuality. But when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that's rather a horse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a continuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition might be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul's original meaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted him, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition. A radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent. tradition to illuminate Paul's original meaning, but not use the Catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be. --clh]

Subject: >>SALE:bulk enviro T-shirts!!<< I am not a company, thus this is not a commercial sale.   I purchased 256 T-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through.  We didn't have the time to sell the shirts.  I have about 175 shirts left and I am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts, even in bulk)  (That's $918.75 for 175 shirts)  These shirts are Jim Morris T-shirts.  They are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4 colors.  (They are clean and neatly folded in a box.  If any happen to be damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace it, your option.)  You could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece (the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school event or a organization.  I realize it is a big investment, but it could pay off big. I would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5.50 a shirt.  I will pay shipping, but prefer local buyers and will give them more bargaining power. Please help me.  I do not have the time to sell these shirts and I need the money.  I am taking a big loss by selling this cheap.  I will give you Jim Morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices. All prices are negotiable. --Truman about this deal.

(Stephen A. Creps) writes: 	  The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free    will in any way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows    everything that is going to happen to us.  We have free will, and    are able to change what happens to us.  However, since God knows    everything, He knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (God    is not subject to time).  Too often arguments pit predestination    against free will.  We believe in both. That last sentence of Steve's is an important one to remember. There are certain things in the Catholic religion that cannot be completely comprehended by a human being.  Were this not the case, it would be good evidence that the religion was man-made. In the case of predestination, you have to reconcile two things that would at first appear to be irreconcilable: the sovereignty of God's will over all things, and man's free will in deciding his own fate. Catholics believe in both!  But that doesn't mean that anyone has come up with a pat reconciliation... I have often thought that Goedel's famous theorem has applicability to Catholic dogma, at least in an analogous sense: there are things that are true that cannot be proved.  God's intellect is far above ours. There are many truths that we will never be able to understand.

Look, I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves, but they're not anything like your Caloric gas range.  It takes about three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards  you can't just "shut it off" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24  hours even after you choke it COMPLETELY. So it ain't exactly "light up the stove and cook me a batch of them  pancakes, Aunt J..."  If you use a woodstove for cooking, or even for heating your house at night, you will have it lit to SOME extent all  the time.  Trust me on this one, I speak from experience. --

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book "Colon Cleansing for Health and Longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics, along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts the immune system to a significant degree. He also plugs a unique appliance called the "Colema Board", which facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over $100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash, supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its bulkiness. If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very interested to hear about research and personal experience. This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon fasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification. -- Eli --  /-------------------------------------------------------------------------\ \-------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Hey all, I'm looking at buying a new car, but I'm confused about the insurance coverage.  This also applies to my existing car insurance policy.  Does anyone understand what the "Limited Tort Option" means.  Will it lower my rates if I opt to have it, or will it be more expensive if I opt to have it?  What does it do for me (in layman's terms please)?  Is it a good deal or should I ignore it?  I'm not the type to sue anyone at a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to the insurance company as a vandalism claim.  Please help. Thanks in advance. George

GM has always screwed the rest of the divisions in favor of the Corvette. The current platform is no exception. The "detuned" Camaro and Firebird is a load of crap to keep people from realizing that they can buy one of these instead of a Corvette and save about $10,000. I like the idea of an Impala SS, but if they really wanted to impress me, they would throw in a big phat 454. Imagine the cops in their Taurus police package 3.0 and 3.8 litres as they stare at your taillights...

>Aargh! > >Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the NHL. >He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques. >The Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself, >was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords >get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!! If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's, I'd be thanking Stewart for calling as few penalties as possible. Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay.  Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is truly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five,  were quite stoppable.  								Alan

Here is a potentially dumb question: What prevents the martian landers themselves from "polluting" the martian environment with earth based critters? Is the long trip in cold radiation bathed space enough to completely sterilize the landers?

I haven't seen any mention of this in a while, so here goes... When the Hubble Telescope was first deployed, one of its high gain antennas was not able to be moved across its full range of motion.  It was suspected that it had been snagged on a cable or something.  Operational procedures were modified to work around the problem, and later problems have overshadowed the HGA problem. Is there any plan to look at the affected HGA during the HST repair mission, to determine the cause of its limited range of motion?  Is the affected HGA still limited, or is it now capable of full range of motion? -- Steve Derry

Subject: "Production Hold" on '93 Firebird/Camaro w/ 6-Speed with "Pontiac Systems" or "Pontaic Customer Service" or whatever, and inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and Trans Am.  BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me nowhere.  After being routed to a "Firebird Specialist", I was able to confirm that this is in fact the case. At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio. She wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this, feel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved. Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related to the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is a production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore having to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positive that this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would. Can anyone else shed some light on this?

Ever since I was a kid and learned to tell when I was in a  dream I have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems. In my dreams I have done everything from yell at my mom to machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual fantasies. I have deliberately done things that I would never do in real life. I understand the need to control ones thoughts, but I always felt that dreams were format free, no morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes I would  have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.) Is this an incorrect attitude? Rather than weakening my inhibitions, I could argue that I got certain things "out of my system" by  experiencing them in dreams. By analyzing a dream I can determine if I have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream something will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and see if it really bothers me or not. I can't believe that other people don't do the same. It seems  silly to attach moral significance to dreams. I think that this is entirely different from out of body experiences, which I have never had. Contradictions welcome. Chris Mussack

It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-). Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in '65; that was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing team (in favor of the Ford GT program the next year). That victory broke a 13(?) year Ferarri winning streak. Well, there's lotsa info I could spout, but I'll refrain. Much of this information comes from "Hot Rod" magazine's "Shelby American Cobra/Mustang Guide," which has more info on the Shelby-American  Fords than you could _ever_ want to know.

Here is a press release from the American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees.  Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other Unions Commemorate Workers Memorial Day and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130    WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth annual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6 million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.    This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work. Earlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert Vallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections facility in Lucasville, Ohio.    The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady increase in the prison population for the past five years.  On Jn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections show a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an expected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.    The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the number of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain high.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff, compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.    The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous combination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in the nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis B, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.    AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's federal, state and local correctional facilities.    Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under life-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers die from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from occupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's most dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:    -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and       frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are       not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.    -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of       job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector       employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more       than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private       sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the       previous year.  It is generally believed that health care       workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes       have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses       than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety       issues facing health care workers include exposure to       tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high       levels of stress.    -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health       institutions are often the victims of assaults and,       sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man       carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler       County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.       and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the       gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a       growing lack of support services for people who don't have       the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some       clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.       Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.       The "quality" of the clients is also becoming more violent,       as more are moved out of the institutions.    Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards since OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety protections for public employees.    "More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the job, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA coverage for public employees," said McEntee.  "This, despite the fact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers, corrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most dangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater rights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees safe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful."    Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private sector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more severe.    Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed in 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states have no OSHA coverage.  -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

So, one of the charges against Koresh seems to be Contempt of Cop -- he expressed hostility to the BATF.

I recently came across this article which I found interesting. I have  posted it to hear what other people feel about the issue. I realise it is rather long (12 pages in Wordperfect) by may well be worth  the read. Except for the first page (which I typed) the rest was scanned inusing  Omnipage. Some of the f's have come out as t's and visa-versa. I have tried  to correct as much as possible. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Peter Hammond is the founder of Frontline Fellowship, a missionary organisation witnessing to the communist countries in Southern Africa. He has also made several visits to many East European countries. FRONTLINE FELLOWSHIP NEWS                          ISSN 1018-144X PRAYING FOR JUSTICE (by Peter Hammond) To those involved in ministering to Christians suffering persecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source of comfort. And those of us who are fighting for the right to life of the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or crime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God has entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms. THE IMPRECATORY PSALMS Early in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for judgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to respond to them. Prayers such as: "Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for his wickedness ..." Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the gospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly motivated by love for God ("The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nation will perish from His land" 10:16, and "Why does the wicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who suffer ("You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You encourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more." 10:17-18) Nevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such graphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: "Pour out your wrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them" 64:24; "O Lord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O Judge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve." 95:1-2; "Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them vanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, "Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.'" 58:6-11 Certainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply destressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray for God to "pour out His wrath" on the wicked? The scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be prayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies. Rather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against His enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these imprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who "boast of evil" and "are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots destruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise deceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth." 52:1-3; "They crush your people ... They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless." 94:5- 6; "With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot against those You cherish." 83:3; "You hate all who do wrong. You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord abhors." 5:5-6. To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares: "Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin" 52:5; "Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who go on in their sins" 68:21. And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: "Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ..." 59:13; "to proclaim the powers of God" 68:34; "All kings will bow down to Him and all nations will serve Him " 72:11; "Who knows the power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear that is due You. " 90:11 Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include imprecations (prayers invoking God's righteous judgement upon the wicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church. However, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much more common. PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS Amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I found the survivors of communist persecution including the crippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church. I was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven pray "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?" Revelation 6:10). The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino Neto. Described as a "drunken, psychotic, marxist poet", Neto had been installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola. He boasted that: "Within 20 years there won't be a Bible or a church left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity." Yet despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is not Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto. Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in Moscow. In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded of God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:   *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be      arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.   *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles      in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be      turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in      fact carried out. But the next day when the official was      medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal      cancer. He died shortly afterwards.   *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a      Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car      crash the very next day.   *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on      the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to      carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted      gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,      the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to      dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded      with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would      not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against      Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building      was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.      "They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord      Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the      Lord spread widely and grew in power. " Acts 19:17,20 Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the persecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and executed on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of "the antiChrist is dead" in the streets. Many testified that this was in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of Romania. Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora Machel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in the 1960's. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would destroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly Marxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in Mozambique were closed confiscated, "nationalised" chained and padlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled, some being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians, including many pastors and elders, were shipped off to concentration camps - most were never seen again. A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly and challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him (Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were specifically praying for God to stop the persecution in Mozambique, Machel's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent thunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa's boundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans for overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and published. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor, but He had also saved a country from persecution. In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in Zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27 year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on 31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to Christ whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected president of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian country. It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots, declared trembling and in tears: "I am more afraid of John Knox's prayers than of an army of ten thousand". On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African Communist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented international wave of condolences and adulation reported one could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a martyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa this Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani. The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people were murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of the SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other victims. Indeed the SA government, the international community and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported over this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans murdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were unbanned! Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973, Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC's "military wing" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many unarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: "all who live by the sword will die by the sword " Matt 26:52. After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities at a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly declared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs and limpet mines in public places during "the struggle") I told him that I was a Christian and, while I didn't hate him, I did hate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either bring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God would remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he was an atheist. Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani to repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in America have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against unrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck down, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer, within months of these public prayers for God to stop these killers of preborn babies. Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted: "When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror to evildoers " Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any Christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any - even of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory prayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did our Lord (Matt 11:20-24). What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be? Should we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I would like to present a short summary of an excellent book, "War Psalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory Psalms" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company): Our Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly in teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the Old Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT are from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50 times. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible. 1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God? Some Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as "devilish", "diabolical ", "unsuited to the church", and "Not God 's pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of a man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus' teaching that we should love our enemies. " Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares: "All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. " (see also 2 Peter 3:15-16). The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its inspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil is to impudently take the place of God. Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God have led many to become "evangelic plastic surgeons who have made it their job to "clean up" God's Word according to their own ideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone who must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for His Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the authority of God's Word (like Eve's original sin of listening to Satan's question "Yes, hath God said... ?"). The Psalms are part of God's revelation of Himself and His attributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the authoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these evangelical plastic surgeons reject as "unsuited" and "unworthy" for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about Himself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles used as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb 4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2. CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially Ps 109): "Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage which the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in judgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would speak to us therein. " The rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of the giver of that Word, God Himself. 2. Who is praying these Psalms? Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually spoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an enormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer book and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at the Last Supper. On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient authority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own words - the words of the Lord's Anointed - which as David's Son He truly was. "Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit" Ps 31:5 "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" Ps 22:1 In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on the day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so! Matt 7:23 "Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers'. " Ps 6:8 In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ although nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said these words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22 directly to Christ despite there being no record of His having spoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed Christ is speaking in the Psalms. Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in all the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again to execute Judgement on the wicked. David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a prototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30: "being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of Christ. " David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in his words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah spoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by Christ. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His forerunner David. The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of God, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion for the wronged. 3. But what about the Psalms of repentance? Christ is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for our sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with the sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for which He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the substitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah 53). "God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God. " 2 Cor 5:21 In history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have been understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others. All the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the imprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord Jesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is only right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy His enemies. These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of King Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God's Word is revealed upon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God's way of forgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses of God. He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a reality when He declares to those on His left: "Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. " Matt 25:41 All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God's Kingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone will reign forever! "With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. " Rev 19 : 15 4. Are Jesus' prayers contradictory? What about Jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us (Matt 5:44)? Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives sin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement on those who disobey His Gospel. "God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in His holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have believed. " 2 Thess 1:6-10 Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on earth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see both the vengeance and the love ot God. Even in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations. "Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of greed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? " Matt 23 In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His betrayal by Judas. We also need to acknowledge that Christ's prayers of blessing are not for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only praying to the elect of God - those who have: "obeyed your Word"... "accepted" God's Word ... and have "believed ". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the message of God's kingdom will be judged.) 5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms? Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays: "Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done " then "he must put all the opposition to this in one pile and say: 'Curses, maledictions and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and wisdom and plans run aground' . " To pray tor the extension of God's kingdom is to solicit the destruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: "The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. " * Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darkness. * There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church cannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God's kingdom. God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom being destroyed. God's will cannot be done on earth without the destruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of evil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism which insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights of man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God. Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who "plot together" against God and His people: "Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O Lord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground. " The story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5) provides a vivid example of God's judgement on the wicked. Sisera "cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years" and they "cried to the Lord for help" Judges 4:3. In response to those prayers: "The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot... All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. " Judges 4:15-16 The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the tent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The song of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of the head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is this that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. "As you did to Sisera ..." 6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience The imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:      "If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,      which are written in this book, and do not revere this      glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord      will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He      will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you      dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also      bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not      recorded in this Book of the Law until you are      destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...      so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be      uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. "      Deuteronomy 28:58-63 The covenant God made with His people included curses for disobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27 records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in an awesome account: "The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice: "Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing detestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - and sets it up in secret. " Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" " "Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother... "Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone... "Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads... "Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow... "Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly... "Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. "Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by carrying them out. Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" " Deut 27:14-26 The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of rejecting Christ is the curse. "If anyone does not love the Lord - a curse be on him. " 1 Corinthians 16:22 (See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26- 31; 12:14-29.) 7. How can we preach these prayers? The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders. Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander- in-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on those orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we expect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the strongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not hear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him onto the battlefield? Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church's Commander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders. The pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of a courier in any earthly army. There's no place tor the dispatcher to decide he doesn't agree with his Commander's strategy. When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching mission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom (Lk 10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God's rule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on any house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected it, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we must consider what He said they should do if their message were rejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against God's rule - "But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its 'streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near"' Luke 10:11. What would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent fire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that town (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message (verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great authority He had given them: "He who listens to you listens to Me; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects him who sent Me " (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor calling down God's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion against God's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of His servants. We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the Prince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its lethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks will be inevitable. Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is that God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he reap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in Deut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings 6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant breakers is real. The "I" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The "we" of the Psalms includes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our own, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The Psalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record Christ's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As Christ is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will answer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the final day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when He will say: "But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be King over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me" Luke 19:27. A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to obey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war psalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God's kingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by the kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local congregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your battalion to put on the whole armour of God, including "the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God " Eph 6:17. That battle- readiness also involves "pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18. Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the enemies of God as the psalmist did: "Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not call on Your Name" Ps 79:6. To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it is necessary for us to pray for God's justice. Those who are persecuted need the comfort of these prayers. "Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against them. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. " Ps 149:5-9 Prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for conversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement on those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army of God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He has given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people nf God to destroy evil. If you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or undermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword anew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of Jesus - until "the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea" Hab 2:14.

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on real life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different directions.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area. I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection. But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there was another trap.  And there was! On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator changes.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the  place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none. I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks.                                        -Barry --  -----                                                                   -------- Chelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319 Chelmsford, MA

No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies   you mention, and since Koresh "apparently" has a different view point from your   Baptist upbringing, then he is not worthy of protection from religious   persecution.  As to being the Messiah, is not Christ within us all? Must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion. Baptists are a cult, two, BTW, under most of the definitions in the dictionary   of "cult".

I can't see what you are objecting to: someone is saying what historians of all beliefs would agree on, and you are calling him a closed-minded bigot? You really ought to say what you mean by "belief in Jesus Christ". It is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a Christian. Muslims believe in Jesus Christ although they believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated Son of God. But followers of Eastern religions might be quite happy to say that Jesus was the incarnation of God - along with large numbers of other historical and mythical figures. So perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say precisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it is to be a Christian, as handed down by the Universal Church, you object to but regard as unnecessary for being a Christian.

You're a sorry son of a bitch if you can't draw a distinction between these two things. People like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths who aren't deserved of it.

About two years ago I posted the following:   I am planning to write a new book called "Great Canadian Scientists."   The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have to be born in Canada or even live in Canada, but they must have (or have had, if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great Canadian scientists.   About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this posting.   I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible.   Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist.   After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy Kidder's "Soul of a New Machine" or some other dramatic technique. The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with  one paragraph biographies.   If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear them.   So far, I have received 68 nominations as follows:     First Name     Last Name      Nominator            Famous For ----------     ---------      ---------            ---------- Sid            Altman         Kuszewski, John      Catalytic RNA(Nobel Chem 89) Frederick      Banting        me                   Insulin (Nobel U23 medicine) Davidson       Black          Stanley, Robert      Discovered Peking Man James R.

It's amazing to see just how much was discovered by Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, but became Americans after graduate school.   Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.   If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop me a line. ==================================================   That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist, "What I was doing when I was 12", So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There  will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well.   I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close  to being it. Hope to find one soon.    I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of  the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.   I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists, and to discuss what is "great" what is "Canadian" and what is "scientist".

>Okay, the earth has a magnetic field ... >...if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty..

Can you use electricity to power a space/low earth orbit >vehicle? and i fyou can, can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power >it?? The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say "propel" rather than "power", the answer is "sort of".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential applications for this. However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations, however. What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays, and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it. If you want more information, trying looking up "electrodynamic propulsion", "tether applications", and "magsails". >Can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the >electrical field? No.  A "dragless" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if* there was no drag.  This is why there are quotes around "dragless". --

Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives. I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done, since they had not been born yet. Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "Neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born." Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate Easau when Esau has done nothing bad? I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example, consider the saying in Matthew 6:24  + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one  + and love the other, or.... Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take second place. In our original example, second place means that Jacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ.      *****     *****     *****     *****     ***** Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the Baptist:  + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come. I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing and living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah.  I do not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently, neither did he (John 1:21).  Yours,  James Kiefer

[does he believe in predestination] >Of course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine as >Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church >has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  really?  you may be right, but i'd like proof.  as far as i know (and i am not a div school student!) the catholic church does not seem to accept predestination.  my chaplain told me "beware of greeks bearing gifts" with reference to this doctrine: it seems to have the curious result that human beings are not held responsible for their own actions!  i'll answer how you deal with this in a minute. >But to say >that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free >will.

However, unlike the Calvinists and >Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with >the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  right.  that doesn't really seem like predestination to me, but i'll continue with what you're saying.... >For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, >who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final >perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those >without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their >obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need >it, as they had freely chosen hell. this is really confusing to me, especially since i still believe that christ jesus died for ALL of us.  preknowledge of obstinacy seems like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses.  but then, i am not really biblically supported in this opinion -- or am i? others? >People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own >effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined >them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish >because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were >deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and >sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit. so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed and not where it isn't?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved, and nothing in between.  hmmmm. >>yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that >>punishment at the last judgement.  > >Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some >blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), >for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.   although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause social problems, it ends up doing just that -- if there is supposed to be some sort of "sign" that someone is elect, like lots of children or success at work, then those who have a good life on earth will go around thinking that those who don't are doomed to hell. in a way, though, this sounds like the opposite idea -- those doomed to hell will have a great life on earth.  that's almost like the converse of what i believe -- responsibility for what we do now will be punished after we die.  you're saying what we get after we die has a direct bearing on how we live now?  strange....   >And >those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one >or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal >punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it >(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were >forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)

Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from >the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, >Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc. so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if it's  sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine?

Picture our universe floating like a log in a river.  As the log floats down the river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the bank, the bottom, other logs.  When this collission occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the log degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy  translaions occur.  The distribution of damage to the log depends on the shape of the log. However, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a termite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the collissions would appear uniformly random in direction. This is my theory for GRB.  They are evidence of our universe interacting with other universes!  Why not!  Makes just as much sense as the GRB coming from the Oort cloud! The log theory of universes can't be ruled out! Of course, I'm a layman in the physics world.  You  physicists out there, Tell me about this !!!!

Oh, and lastly, I have a very few error cards and a few cards that were originally intended to be used as card #1, but the company changed their mind.  None of these cards are easy to get. Anyway, if you have some interest in any of these cards, please drop me a line, as I am most eager to sell a bunch off. Oh, and if you are interested, I also have 1 set of Hot Shots '92 left, and about 2 sets of California Dreaming cards as well.

Being wierd again, so be warned: Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to keep watch? I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion. How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things around and near and on Pluto.. I know it is a strange idea, but why not?? It could do some scanning of not only Pluto, but also of the solar system, objects near and aaroundpluto, as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy without having much of the solar system to worry about.. ==

Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have  wondered, "If it wasn't suicide, why did so few get out?"  The  answer is now available - the gas the government had been pouring in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the chemical weapons treaty. The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in wartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including  nnocent children. For confirmation see Friday's CLINTON:AM press briefing by George Stephanopoulous, posted in alt.news-media and other locations. (When questioned about it, his reply was that the treaty did not forbid its internal use by law enforcement agencies.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting from Stephen F.

The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false. Texas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges. They COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably.  The COULD and DID impound his weapons for the duration.  And Koresh was NOT CONVICTED. Note that child abuse and similar accusations are STATE matters, not federal.  The state COULD and DID handle them properly and peaceably, and furthermore violating no one's constitutional rights in the process. So maybe the best way for BATF/FBI to save people is to mind their  own fucking business. --

> No.  A "dragless" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel > constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if* > there was no drag.        Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can  engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order  harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a  satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of  months to years.       My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT  satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In  particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in  altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude  of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18  March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the  limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.)      This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71  degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is  unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But  it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the  situation.      (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

I need some information on the implications of receiving cortisone shots for a seasonal allergic condition.   I've had the usual "skin prick" tests for the common allergies, but reacted to none of the substances. So for the last two seasons I've received cortisone shots but the doctors seem reluctant to give more than two or three shots.  Why?  What are the dangers?

Being "frightening" isn't a crime.  Some people are afraid of young Black males.  That doesn't make the mere status of being a young Black male a crime. The BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  There is no evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement  personnel.  Under those circumstances, other persons have been found to be acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified armed intruders. >     At this point I place little or no credibility on any of the charges  > of child abuse or molestation, but I would remind you that the Branch  > Davidians aren't the only ones burying their dead. >  The charges are irrlevant anyway, since the BATF has absolutely no jurisdiction in such matters anyway.

[Someone asked about Biblical support for the image of Satan as a fallen angel.  Rev 12:7-9 and Enoch have been cited.  --clh] There is also a verse in Luke(?) that says He[Jesus] saw Satan fall from Heaven.  It's something like that.  I don't have my Bible in front of me or I would quote it directly, but it's a pretty obvious reference to Satan's expulsion. Justin [I believe the reference is to Luke 10:18.  The context of the passage makes it possible that Jesus is referring to Satan being defeated by Jesus' mission, rather than a previous fall from heaven.  --clh]

This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a  sharing on the "Johannine hours" as proposed each month by the monks of  the ecumenical community of Taize (pronounced te-zay) in France. NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP:  ========================== soc.religion.taize (Unmoderated) PURPOSE OF THE GROUP:  ==================== The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks  based in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in  their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a  sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a  monthly "Johannine Hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each  month. A "Johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given Bible  passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that  may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be  posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less  in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another  to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own  life-journey. The idea of "Johannine hours" was born in Taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the midst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence, we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of Christ. During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we  understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions,  we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to  communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening  them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought  us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply. Perhaps those who read and think about the "Johannine Hours" in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others. The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network. BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY: ================================= The following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community. World War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost abandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring together a monastic community which would live out "a parable of community", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal refugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation. AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent the first two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949, seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation. Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North and South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no capital. The brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an international Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming people in Taize. TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and less young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since 1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental meetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any one week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to 6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church of Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too small. "A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH" The community has never wanted to create a "movement" around itself. Instead, people are called to commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood, their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created what it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". At the end of each year, the pilgrimage has a "European meeting" which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for several days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia and in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open letter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year. NOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in         news.groups. --   . 1st 1.10b #332 . Taize-Community, 71250 TAIZE, France

  Are there any members of conservative, religious, politically active groups (such as the Christian Coalition) out there?  I come from a very liberal  background, and I'd like to talk to some conservative people out there in a  public forum (such as this one.)  I frankly can't understand the rationale or Christian basis for much of the conservative position, and I'd like to try and learn more about this movement--after all, we're part of the same church.  Is anyone interested in explaining a bit about the conservative viewpoint?   Thanks.

I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs a MIDI/sound card (Sound Blaster Pro is preferred) to have its fantastic features show up. As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now, I am  putting it here for sale. It's listed $79.95 on April issue of WINDOWS  magazine and I paid $84.95 as the total. I am asking around $70 with shipping included. WinSong for Windows: Composer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one. It's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition. It's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder. Up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward and stop. It plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set, saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many. You do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual is handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and stifling aspect. Almost NEW (one week OLD), unregistered $70 (including shipping) OBO (please be reasonable)
   _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely    no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have    to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to    "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching    by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at    least it was a good try... So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances? Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models. A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this line    get 9304001 Here is the abstract of that paper.    The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them    at cosmological distances;    but as long as there is no distance    indicator to these events all possible sources which are    isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is    why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,    although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs    from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs    originate in the solar cometary cloud    cannot be excluded until it is disproved.    We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE    catalogue up to March, 1992), and    the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to    investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations    between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,    assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,    at least to some extent, true variations    in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$    test to both distributions.    We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov    test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a    $\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D    cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for    isolating the effect of possible observational biases.    These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but    the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any    connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations    which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\sim 800$    it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.    Currently,     it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement    found for the $\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort    cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \GRBs.

Subject: "The Word Perfect" EXE file needed A friend of mine managed to get a copy of a computerised Greek and Hebrew  Lexicon called "The Word Perfect" (That is not the word processing  package WordPerfect). However, some one wiped out the EXE file, and she  has not been able to restore it. There are no distributors of the package in  South Africa. I would appreciate it, if some one could email me the file, or  at least tell me where I could get it from.  My email address is   Many thanks. In Him, Paul Fortmann
Does anyone have information about the struggles that Patti Duke went through in her personal life with severe mood swings. Did she have some form of chemical imbalance that triggered these problems?  I recall that she wrote a book about her troubles. Does someone have the title of that book?

Any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there ? The doctor thinks a friend might have this. The question is, doesn't the tick have to bite you ? You frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk in the woods around here, but you tend to notice it before it bites you; pulling one out of your skin is something you're not likely to forget. Can you get the fever without it biting you ?  Do they sometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realize you were bitten ?  I know they will let go once they've had their fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh). So how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick off yourself (as opposed to finding one merely crawling on you) ? John Eyles

The other week I saw a TV program about the american space industry and NASA. It said that in the 60's they developed a rocket that used ions or nuclear particles for propolsion. The government however, didn't give them $1billion for the developement of a full scale rocket. Did anybody see this program? If not, has anybody heard of the particle propolsion system? Thanx. 8-) Glen Balmer...

However Jesus was referring to John the >Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John >(remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to >Elijah. > There is no question of similarity in Jesus indication about John. The passage in Matthew is very direct.  Where Luke (1:17) reports the angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ "in the  power and spirit of Elias", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,        "And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who     was to come". It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, "If you care to accept it", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein- carnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it is.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other topics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of reincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews today, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah Hurnard ("Hinds Feet on High Places") was told about it by a Rabbi she was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine. Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this, whereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about  John, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded but nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one way or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general of the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are  occasional indications that point to it. As for the "popular belief" that Elijah would come again, it was more than  a popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never  corrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought  that Jesus himself be he.

All we've heard is 'its up to the parents'. >  Unfortonately, that truly is about the best summation of the research that there is.  Advantages stated of circumcison included probably prevention of penile cancer, (which, interestingly, occurs mostly in men whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor), simplicity of personal hygiene, prevention of urinary tract infections, and prevention of a unretractible foreskin,  Disadvantages include infection from the  procedure, pain, etc.  I apologize; I am trying to pull this off the top of my head.  I will post what I discovered in research; I did a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school. It really is a decision that is up to the parents.  Some parents use the reasoning that they will "look like Daddy" and like their friends as justification.  There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is what you want to do, since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise a male, although a major surgical procedure exists. >How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water?  We've heard  >stories of infection, etc.  How about after the water has broken? >  As long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any problems with your pregnancy, it should be OK to sit in a tub of water. HOWEVER, I WOULD RECOMMEND USING YOUR OWN BATHTUB IN YOUR OWN HOME! It is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of "public" hot tubs.  A nice warm bath can be very relaxing, especially if your back is killing you!  And it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath soap , esp. if you are prone to yeast infection. Hope these tips help you some. Elisa

This whole thread is rediculous.  Who cares if they had a stove going or not.

: That's not inner calm.  It's boredom, and it's being spoiled.  The Arena's : been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just : take winning for granted.  It's been seemingly forever since the team : lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and : surprise at victory. At least last night there was some excitement. The Pens  didn't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like  the previous two games. I'm not sure if NJ just rose up and  played better or if the Penguins just started to play down  somewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey  seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end. They  did much more swarming around, which at least kept an  element of suspense in the game. No question that Billington  helped make it more interesting also. Claude Lemieux didn't  help the cause any though, with his ejection early in the  game.

	This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio for ESPN hockey. 	The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the Pitt-NJ game  (even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the Wash-Ny game  going to overtime.  When the Caps scored with :02 left to tie the game, Al said he heard many people say f**K .!#$%.   	ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT broadcast the OT of the hockey game.

The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new' technology for hearing aids. The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' situations. The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable), apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies, while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness'. This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point. You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff). Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components. Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations.  USA

   Before the S4 became the S4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v.    This model did come in a wagon, a very quick wagon.  Very rare also. 						      Mike Sylvester  Umass Being a satisfied Audi owner (-90 100 turbo quattro. my 4:th Audi) I get the free VAG magazine. The latest issue presented a new S4 Avant (wagon) with a 4.2 litre V8. I'd like one of these ;-) Btw, this is my second quattro and my third turbo and I must say that even in the summer, with dry roads, the quattros give so much extra in road holding and balance that I hope I can afford them always.

Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking "If I put a blackbody in interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'), what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field?"    If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and  molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far from being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings "Interstellar Processes", ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson, Jr., published in 1987.  Try the articles by Tielens et al., Seab, and  Black.    Inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bit from place to place (how close are you to the nearest OB association, I would guess).  Outside the galaxy, of course, things aren't so  varied.    I hope this is what you were looking for.... --  -----                                                    Michael Richmond

# # Which Article of the Constitution gives me the right of revolution if things # seem to be going cockeyed?? # # Hmmm... # -- # Peter G. White, President, Synthesis 93 Inc. # Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. Dunno if you'll find it in the Constitution, but that other document of American liberty, that kids are taught to hallow in school, is the Declaration of Independence.  That document is in fact a justification not just for the right if revolution, but of the DUTY of revolution by the people, once the government gets too oppressive.  It is a very radical document, and I recommend all Americans... especially those in office... read it once a year.

They were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo.  50mm would be 5cm; a shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells. Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  Besides, the ranch house (not "fort apocalypse"; it was just a house despite what the FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The "Gun loonies" couldn't hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames. The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well* under way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't even tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that the FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve. Someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life. Sadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American people will probably believe them. > Next question. >  >  > The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters > to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place. This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns *and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On the other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their compound. But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons hasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke any laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this is his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified. The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol violations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of their jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO. > The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to > attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had > had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type > raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults. Sounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are "heavily-armed religious wackos". David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out peacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON THEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud. > It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity  > to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead > he ordered the murder of the children.   Don't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions of committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this. Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the Waco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die. > In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive > the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the  > suicide/murder of his other 80 followers.

Some agents were armed with automatic pistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous. > The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely.

Gun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government seems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.  This greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well. > This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its > agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the > middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters. >  > Still the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that > WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in  > resolving a hostage crisis.

IMHO this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough.   I do not like a God who prays to Himself.  I refuse to believe Jesus prayed to Himself  --   let's get real, if the scriptures say He prayed to the Father, then the Father IS someone different than the Son.  I have no problems with multiple Gods.  To me, the whole context of the scriptures says:  Be perfect, even as your Father Who is in Heaven; that we can be co-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him.   Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc. When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God.   If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God. If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God.   But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods.   [I don't know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself.  The whole point of the Trinity is that there's enough of a distinction within God that relationship is possible.  This implies some sort of communication.  I assume that in their "native" form, the Father and Son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't involved.  But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son, i.e.  the Logos made flesh.  When he's in a human form, his human actions are limited to human capabilities.  So communication with the Father takes the form of prayer.  I don't see that there's anything problematical about that.  It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation. --clh]
Lots of debate about the virtues of Bryan Murray vs Pat Quinn as a GM deleted.  Randy Graca seems to think Murray is the best GM in the league. I think Quinn is one of several who are better. >>Plus his team (Quinn's) has improved a much greater amount than Detroit since >>he took over with them. > >How do you figure?  Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year: >They both won their division, they had close to the same number of points, >they both went down 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally >escaping in 7 games, and they both got knocked out in the second round by >teams they should have been able to beat, with less talent.  (Specifically, >if I remember correctly, third place teams).  How does this make Vancouver >more improved?  Further, if I'm not mistaken, the Wings had more points than >Vancouver at the end of this season (albeit not many).  When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they  regularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved the team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender. When Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup contender. So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM. Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray. Gregmeister

Also he said it is not unheard of >>that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved. >Did your ENT also tell you that this procedure may remove warts from the soles >of your feet and improve your sex life? Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2 mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways, however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this. The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery, though. About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage (postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation. Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery, as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis. Jon Noring --  Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle, but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars in California.  What a bunch of crap.  Diesel is the fuel of choice for  enviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason. The particulates are nothing but carbon.  They are just an annoyance at worst. Nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions, torque or engine durability.  It's also cheaper. --  Horace Dediu                                                  GTE Laboratories (617) 466-4111                                                40 Sylvan Road

From Bit.listserv.christia Zane writes...     "Frank, first of all, thanks for all of the great Scripture verses.  It was a pleasure to read them."   MY REPLY... You are welcome, Zane.   Zane... "I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you. I mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you have read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain that will result in your Christian life?"   MY REPLY... (1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith     movement.  It was easy.  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound     doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I     could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.     Consequently, I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine (and they     still send it to me), and also Copeland's (also, still sent to me).     It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:     The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were     partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying     more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my     experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that     these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in     Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!   (2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith "cult" in my area - it's     leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into     much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and     has now fallen into atheism.  I'm still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).   (3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been     a `follower' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the     Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers'     heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I've been able to talk     to him at length about these issues.   (4) The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan'.     Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to     women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as     my lending CIC to people in the church.   I'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies. What heresies?     A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became         one with him.     B. Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone.     C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by         Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling         over Him there.     D. Jesus was `born-again' in hell.     E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after         the resurrection.     F. We are gods.   These are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings upon request.   Zane... "Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out and joining up with the word/faith movement which you'd been contemplating joining for so long, but now that you've read the book, you've been saved from all of that?"   MY REPLY... It wasn't _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet by Swaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendous documentation and insights.   Zane... "I don't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un- profitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting."   MY REPLY... Why do you call it "heresy hunting"?  "Hunting" implies it isn't readily accessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in Christendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has sold more books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  Fred Price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn't sound like much "hunting" is needed.   It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before. More can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal, practical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to expose error and heresy.  It's not a new thing.  Remember Luther?   Zane... "I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt heretics often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un- documented opinion."   MY REPLY... (1) If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated. (2) Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes     disunity and immaturity in the body.   EPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting....   Disunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it's caused by error.   Zane... "There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as documenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I would suggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End."   MY REPLY... Most scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Let's examine his admonitions to Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become...   2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.   2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some.   2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.   2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.   2TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.   2TI 4:2-5 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.   2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.   Zane... "The picture I have of Paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolves... but of one who teaches the sheep, with many tears, the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into wolves to protect themselves."   MY REPLY... ACT 20:26-31 "Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. "For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. "Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. "For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. "Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. "Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.   Zane... "For all the warning Paul does, it is of note that he never once drops a name of a wolf....  - but I will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those who have abandoned him - everyone in Asia wasn't it ?"   MY REPLY... Paul mentioned names...   1TI 1:18-20 This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.   2TI 1:15 This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.   2TI 2:16-18 But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some.   2TI 4:10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica--Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia.   2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.   So did John...   3JO 1:9-10 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church.   Jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines...   REV 2:14-16 "But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality. "Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. 'Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.   REV 2:20-23 "Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. "And I gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent. "Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds. "I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.   Zane... "I question too, the purposes of those who write books and build ministries on the faults - deliberate or otherwise - of others.  Maybe if they would wander around in the desert eating locust and honey, or barely cakes...with no worldly goods at stake, money to be made, or no reputations to maintain... I would question their motives - conscious or otherwise - less."   MY REPLY... I won't comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others. But even if they had bad motives, remember what Paul said...   PHI 1:15-18 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from good will: The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.   Zane... "If we want to be true to the admonitions of Scripture - many of which you list - about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of doctrines, I suggest we start by allowing the wolf-program in our own noetic pasture to be nailed to the Cross."   MY REPLY... Please explain.   Zane... "Secondly, I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships - which in the strict Scriptural sense is the local city-church."   MY REPLY... If heresy was not being propagated over the mass media, then it may not be needed to go mass media with the exposure.  Unfortunately, heresy is being taught not just in Copeland's church or Hagin's or Hinn's or Price's, but all over the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It's imperative that leadership be made aware of this, and CIC does just that.   Also, let's examine a passage of Scripture... * EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, * EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,   These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one individual church, but for "the body of Christ". Paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was also a teacher - 1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church. 1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.   Also - 1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues.   * EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;   Notice that the "Five-Fold" ministries are going to be around "till" the church is in "unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man".  This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see 1Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hinders maturity and unity of the body?   * EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,   It's clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church "by the trickery of men" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritual immaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are "tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine".   The "Five -Fold" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clear Scriptural denominational boundaries ("pastors" appear responsible for their individual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their struggle to equip the body.   All believers are called to do this to a degree... JUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.   Zane... "If you'll notice, in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church to Church and area to area, were the "bad guys" and they went after the "good guy" namely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic."   MY REPLY... They were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preaching contrary to what they taught!   Zane... "Let's face it, the wolves are here for a reason.  And we are here for the Reason.  And let's hope the wolves become sheep, and the sheep, lambs."   MY REPLY... Yes! 2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,                                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~ God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.

 I understand the when one is in orbit, the inward force of gravity at one's center of mass is exactly balanced by the outward centrifugal force from the orbiting motion, resulting in weightlessness.  I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like. For example, is there a constant sensation of falling? And what is the motion sickness that some astronauts occasionally experience?   Please reply only if you are either a former or current astronaut, or  someone who has had this discussion first-hand with an astronaut.  Thanks! --  Jerry Liebelson

Hi everyone, I'm trying to find my way to God, but find it difficult as I can't hear God talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and that he knows me, and I feel that I can't possibly get to know him until he does. Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just don't know or understand how to listen. Some Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find God is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover. This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit frightening, but I have a few questions. 1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say, "OK God, her you go, I'm committing my life to you", I wouldn't really feel that he'd listened - at least, I couldn't be sure that he had. So how does one (or how did you) commit oneself to God? 2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of my current life? What can I no longer do? I feel that I'm as 'good' as many Christians, and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - I don't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to get jealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the standards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So what do I have to give up? 3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (if any) burdens am I taking on? 4) So then, what's the general difference before and after? I assume, that (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) it won't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens? 5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I find out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?! Thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. Perhaps e-mail would be a better way to reply, but it's up to you. Ben. (20 year-old at University in Scotland)

Greetings netters, 	I have a Seagate 3144 130MB IDE drive forsale.  I bought it yesterday and have been able to come across a 215MB that I am going to buy, but I  need to sell this one.  I guarantee that it will work.  There is still a transferable warranty I believe.  It was only used as a boot drive, not a server (source) drive.  I just want my money back out of it...$180.  Thanks

Some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think. As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance. This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I am not a diving expert). Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition, the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a  pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh? ken

Remember that not every nation follows the English common law.   In most countries, for most of history, it was probably true that the rulers `owned' everything not explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America, where by the principle enunciated, the aboriginal inhabitants should have owned everything, when new arrivals wanted to use land and resources, they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn't noticed, there is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what. Of course, if some friendly super power were to give an international astronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree to defend it if attacked, such a proposal might work, but it would hardly be non-coercive. Some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space and also to use governmental actions (like taxing power, for example) to discourage them.   This of course would be too coercive for Mr. Hart. Dept. of Mathematics, Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL 60208
Actually, I was angry when they went away from the Pens game. Being a Pens fan in central Virginia is kinda tough.  I only get to see them on ESPN, and when they play the Caps, cause we're close enough to DC to get all the Caps games, so when ESPN switched to the Caps, . . . AAAGGGHHH! Matt

With activities beginning at shortly before 5:00 AM yesterday, C9 commanded the spacecraft to execute a series of slews and rolls to provide the MAG (Magnetometer) Team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations for the purpose of better characterizing the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. The spacecraft was commanded back to Sun Star Init state at 9:07 AM to re-establish Inertial Reference.  Transition back to Array Normal Spin began at 11:17 AM, after which the sequence powered on the on-board transmitter at 11:18 AM.  Telemetry reacquisition occurred at approximately 11:30 AM at the 4 KBS Science and Engineering downlink data rate on the High Gain Antenna.  Subsystem engineers report that all systems appear to be nominal.  The command to terminate using the Low Gain Antenna for uplink was sent at 12:31 PM.  Uplink and Downlink are currently via the HGA. MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3. Playback of DTR 2 is scheduled to take place tomorrow morning between 8:11 AM and 12:42 PM.  Playback of DTR 3 is scheduled to take place tomorrow evening beginning at 11:57 PM and ending at 4:28 AM on Friday. DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second.  Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will be maintained at the 4K S & E rate. The MAG Cal activity timeline ends at shortly before 5:00 AM on Friday morning.      ___    _____     ___     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

While I'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn't be because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. Modern,  ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based telescopes. In any case, a bright point of light passing through the field doesn't ruin observations. If that were the case, the thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned, they are extremely bright.)

Another >>media-event brought to you by HCI. >> >>Is there something similar pro-gun people can do ?  For example, pay $100 >>to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm ?  Sounds a bit >>tacky, but hey, whatever works. As David Veal points out, this sort of "promotion" would be used against gun owners by the mass media. However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area, free, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40 or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion. Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been very well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices interested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but feel they should know something about "gun safety" since members of their family keep guns at home. Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits: (1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases     firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats. (2) A "gun safety" class is Politically Correct, and likely to     be viewed positively by the public and the media. (3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)     and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a     gentle introduction to firearms. (4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun     and become more involved in shooting or personal defense. (5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners     in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,     non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate     the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun     students sometimes tell us they have "something new to think     about" with regards to personal gun ownership. (6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun. Our course is the standard NRA-certified "Home Firearm Safety" class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also teach the NRA's "Personal Protection" class, although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time. I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy-backs.                                -- Alane --    /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    "I am a jelly doughnut"      \  /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \ /-----------------------------------------------------------------------\

The mass available for >instruments is maybe 10% of that.  I don't think a BATSE will fit... From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet, the instrument payload constraints are:     Mass allocation -  7 kilograms (15.4 lbs)     Power allocation - 6 watts     Required instruments: 	Visible imaging system (1024x1024 CCD, 750 mm fl, f/10 optics) 	IR mapping spectrometer (256x256 HgCdTe array, 0.3% energy resolution) 	UV spectrometer (55-200 nm, 0.5 nm resolution) 	Radio science (ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system) 		ultrastable means 10^-14. This doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated to the  mission of the spacecraft.  In addition, the power will come from a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft will be about 2 feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will be strong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in the background, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat. It would still be nice, and our group here at Goddard is looking in to it. --

Even if *all* the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what you say they illustrate, it would still only reflect the written personas (which is often different from face-to-face) of a very, very small and select group.          Anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on Usenet to the general population of any country either doesn't care about accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them.   >USEnet as a whole >disproves it of humanity as a whole.           Speaking of which...         Most of the "readership" posts I've seen put the most read newsgroups at about 160,000 readers, a number I have a feeling is fairly inflated.  The posters, rare and regular, are themseleves a very tiny minority of that group.  And the whole of Usenet readers are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity.          If anything, the only real thing you can get out of the relative sample of Usenet readers is that we've got too much equipment and too much time available to us.   >We now have proof positive that guns don't make you safer.

>But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices "parallel"  >Mormon temple ceremonies.  Could you give an example?  Also, why do they only  >parallel Mormon ceremonies?  Why don't Mormon ceremonies restore the original  >Christian practices?  Wasn't that the whole point of Joseph Smith's stated  >mission? If you want parallels the best source is probably the book _Temple and Cosmos_ by Hugh Nibley.  It is not light reading however. As to why these early practices "only parallel" and do not exactly duplicate the modern LDS ceremony, there are a couple of reasons: 1.  Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient times.  This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces undoubtedly spread.  (Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony get known.)  What we have in the 40 day literature, the Egyptian ceremonies, and certain Native American ceremonies is almost certainly not exactly what Jesus taught. 2.  Certain aspects of the ceremony are normally modified to fit the situation, much as the modern ceremony has been modified to fit the audio-visual tools now available.
Hi. My wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness to gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?) tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are not very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" the  gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of  monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the  'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language, but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the  brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)  My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach? Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this affect the treatment, development? I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and I will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic. I don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established medical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relaying events as they have happened. Sincerely, Erik A. Wolff

Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the  compound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes  from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout.  Unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits  required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally  out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local  community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By  the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame  and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers  and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck,  but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not  have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the  line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient  equipment and water to make a difference. They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia  asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably  irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local  calls could get through. ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who  viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the  standard "pool shot"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been  started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant  to spread so fast. Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed  themselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot  stronger proof than some of the "theories" floating around the net.

Dear fellow Christians,   	I had a dinner last night with a bible study group which       I am in. We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity and Islam. And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, "What??" I did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who are so kind and  nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them (in my point of view, they don't sin as much as I do). How come if they were under Satan, they could have such personalities.  To tell you the truth, I don't know much about Islam. But I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of judgement. 	 	Now I'm  asking you what your opinions about Islam and  its teaching.  IMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not. 	    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam. P.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,      and bit.listserv.catholic. In Christ, our Lord,                           Smile......... 					       Jesus loves you....... 	Tabut Torsina [Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of Islam, since there's a group for that.  But I suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam. Indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians are saved is at the heart of it. The classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until the last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism) was the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions worshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and possibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there's no truth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are intentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare, Satanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might contain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would be missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ. If this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and I suspect it is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily relevant.  The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners may all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a follower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention. This is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position. Christianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and nice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no one is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ. (Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There's a Catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in different terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways.  But if it doesn't have Christ, it's like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying. Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position. What I'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is now relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other religions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move within Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental God.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves. --clh]

I take it that when something happens that is wrong it's okay if a bunch of people say it is?

Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than "Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ...". Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis, but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease. > So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, > controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any > better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.

Thanks for posting the exact wording which I had not seen previously. The part I quote above seems to me to indicate disapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only when other means are not sufficient; I would say this is a stronger restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when justifiable. I would certainly say there are cases where a crime justifies death (perhaps this is the Old Testament interpretation), but my reverence for life would say that I would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a New Testament interpretation?). It is a matter for debate whether the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that non-violent provisions do not. I don't believe it does, and I would certainly observe that in the USA, where you have the death penalty, there is a far higher murder rate than here in the UK, where we do not. Matthew Huntbach
I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans. I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions. eg Temperature range of 280K to 315K (where temp is purely dependant on dist      from the sun and the suns temperature..)    Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance    Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important, how much      can human bodies take day after day.  Also how does the mass effect      atmosphere.  I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the      earth.  I suppose density should be important as well. Climate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc.  Just the above three factors and how they relate to one another.

Once I  >saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of >his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer.   It's a common fallacy you commit.  The non-falsifiability trick.  How can't.  The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove  anything.   When I say it has never been proven, I'm talking about the ones making the claims, not the skeptics, who are doing the proving. The burden of proof rest with the claimant.  Unfortunately,  (pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed in the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (end pontification). But truthfully, Corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe just so poorly translated into English) that much remains unknown about just what Paul really intended (despite claims of hard proof one way or another).  Some will see his writings in 1 cor 12-14 as saying don't do this don't do this and using sarcasm, metaphor, etc. while yet others take what he says literally sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding. Me?  When I read 1 Cor 14 about praying/speaking in tongues regarding building oneself/the church, I see him using compare/contrast, saying do this because it build the church, while doing this builds onself (implying don't do that).  It's a common usage of writing that we all employ, and it is easily seen how it COULD be interpreted this way.  Why some do and some don't is a mystery.

How about that staying inside thing?  Here's another newsflash:  sometimes the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve.

Today the Texas ME found two people, a man and a woman shot in the head inside the burned compound. But these were not the people that the FBI described a few days before. The FBI said that the person found in front of the compound had been shot and several children were also. The two people found today were on top of the main inside concrete bunker that provided the most protection during the fire. So the comment that children were shot is still not proved. --  Defend your 2nd amendment rights.  NRA ACLU VFW Fred Brooks   			        Portland Oregon

	Remember me, Tom?  I hope you'll respond, and I seem to be a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail, so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to make a few points here. >I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America ! >What I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them, and especially >to many in wrong hands.... 	And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting the many?  We say "no," while others say "yes." >Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without >affecting good/responcible gun owners ?? 	Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it. >I DO believe in a persons freedom. >What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it. 	Of course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention is how much one has to pay. >MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE >to give 'a little' to make that society work. 	It is this "giving a little" that makes Americans wary... We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a Chamberlain "gave a little" to a particular fascist/short asshole, and how such "appeasement" worked.  While it might work in some instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of failure. >Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point. >Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b, >so a car is essential in most parts.... >Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't  >argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars..... 	Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in the USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus, cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does guns.  How one defines "essential" often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed. >EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were >more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY! 	This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even when given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace. Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony. One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action. >Is this discussion about >1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans >            or >2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ?? 	It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have wound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that "or" was so logical. >Change of name....... 	That was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out how we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different backgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage. >Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons. >(Child abuse for instance) 	BATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.  Child abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities. >Doesn't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari.news.*  >hierarcy ??  (Some seems rather mis/unInformed) 	That hierarchy is a paid-for feed at many sites.  Most people do not get it for this reason, and I suspect money, not censorship, is the main reason.  Do you get alt.sex* at your site?  I can't read it here because of censorship and legal fears, so again our differences show.

Do you know of the world-wide-web?  This is a global hypertext (well,  hypermedia) network running on the internet.  One of the nice things about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the other systems being used, like WAIS, Gopher, FTP, Archie, etc.  It is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web. If you'd like to explore, I'd suggest getting the XMosaic program, written at the NCSA.  It's an X-windows web browser, and is pretty slick.  It can understand and cope with more than text: gif, jpeg, mpeg, audio, etc.  There are other browsers, including a text-mode browser for people stuck on a text terminal, but I'm most familliar with mosaic. (this is available under the Documents menu in mosaic, or by any browser via the URL  http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html ) there is a subject "Space Science."  Currently this points to a page under construction, with only the NASA JPL FTP archive.  I've volunteered to take over this page, and in fact I have a replacement with all sorts of information pointers (mostly gleaned from the sci.space FAQ).  As soon as the overworked "Subject Catalogue"  maintainer switches the "Space Science" pointer, it'll be visible. I'll post a short note when this happens. --  Frederick G. M.

I'm looking for one that: *  is great for overhead projector slides. *  has or imports clip arts *  works with Word for Windows or imports Word for Windows files. *  works with inkjet printers    If you know of any that meets part or all of the above, please let me know.

In the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with people from this group.  In particular, we discussed how cults operate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations. I include an edited account of what I wrote.  The identity of my correspondents have (I hope) been erased.  The editing process makes the text choppy - sorry about that.  I've tried to retain the information content. Ellipses (...) indicate where text was removed.  A few of the comments in parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand. These notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize. Cheers(?), Oded ------------------------ (begin included text) ----------------------- I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course included cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external reading too). William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of "evil" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY, University of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII, and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think the books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced ..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I think they're onto something. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 		How cult psychology works... 	[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.] So long as Koresh could "own" his people, he made sure they didn't believe there was any life out there for them, away from him. Otherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls. Absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they believed him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even the Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left him, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces of the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful) couldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die too, like the folks in Jonestown. For a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife (or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then themselves.  That's the consequence of shattered "cultism."  It really does happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such cases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no matter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.] ... ----------------------------------------------------------------------     [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?] I agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good (?)  reasons for news blackouts. >	The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted   >	yesterday, those people would be alive today.  ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence. Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He held them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing would really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away! Look at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown, at the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once Jonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his entourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd be busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought up by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are tapes...  The "logic" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it wouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the same with the Branch Davidians. (There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.) ... The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ... So, the only way the BATF/FBI could "save" those people, and future cults, is by ignoring such signs. I suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him into letting them go, or somehow influencing "his" people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world. ... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that with blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe they're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk. ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]     ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.     ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_ playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at checkmate time people really die, and I could be blamed. ... I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you deny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and the rest of the gummint should exist at all.  		(the end) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 			  Okay, have at it.

Well, I agree that if you're going to stand in front of the net, that you should expect to get hit and hacked at. In general, you should expect to finish the game with some bruises. However, there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another player. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of respect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he slashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a Leaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I was very disappointed. You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and for that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd hate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like him very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but intentional) use of the stick. Gary
I'm putting together a list of the civil rights violations perpetrated against the Davidians by the FBI/BATF. Here is what I've got so far. Care to add any or provide more backup info? First Amendment: 1) FBI/BATF violated Davidians right to free exercise of religion from the  	start. We now have a de facto precident against any minority religion. 2) FBI/BATF violated BD right to free speach by: 	a> preventing them to speak to media 	b> preventing them from practicing their beliefs 3) FBI/BATF violated the freedom of the press by: 	a> keeping them 2 miles from the Davidians 	b> preventing the media to cover the FBI/BATF actions close-up 	c> censoring media reports 4) FBI/BATF violated the BD's right to peaceable assemble 	a> proven by initial baseless assault Second Amendment: 1) The BATF went after them because they had too many guns and guns that the 	FBI/BATF didn't approve of. 'Nuff Said. Fourth Amendment: 1) The right of the BD's to be "secure in their persons, houses, papers, and    effects against unreasonable searches and seizures" was violated by: 	a> Initial baseless assault Fifth Amendment: 1) The Davidians were "held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous    crime" without a "presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury." 2) The Davidians were "deprived of life, liberty, and property without due     process of law. Sixth Amendment: 1) The accused were denied the right to "a speedy and public trial by an    impartial jury" when the FBI became judge, jury and executioner. 2) The BD's were never informed of the specific "nature anad cause of the    accusation." Eighth Amendment: 1) The Davidians suffered cruel and unusual punishment when: 	a> The FBI cut off the water to the ranch 	b> The FBI used Psy-War (loudspeakers broacasting the screams of 	   dying rabbits and Tibetian Chants) 	c> The FBI prevented family members from contacting their family 	   inside the ranch. 	d> The FBI used tear-gas against them (especially the children) 	e> The FBI burned the ranch down. 	f> Thoes who escaped were imprisoned without bail without a hearing.

I don't like to see stickwork, but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move (I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm  talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the  player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of  position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with helpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-) Barfly
  Buffalo is up 2-0 is the series with Boston, and the reason....Grant Fuhr ?   Fuhr is playoff hungry, and he's proving once again why they call him   money goaltender. Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the   league anymore (Statistically at least), but he's proving that he can   make the big save at the right time.      The Leafs should have kept Fuhr, and probably would have had a chance    against powerhouse Detroit. But again.......where was Andreychoke in game 1 ?

Regarding the consequences of the original sin: Catholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin, for himself and the human race, was sanctifying grace.  This is basically a share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk: what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar. It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers of any possible creature.  This is the "everlasting life" that the New Testament speaks of. What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying grace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by which this life is given to people, and its increase fostered. The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion from Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it's impossible for a human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying grace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and attempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither can human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace. This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since both have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot enter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they cannot enter into Heaven. Turning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the Catholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some change in an infant's soul, there is no particular reason to insist on the practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the Apostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly thereafter. There is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself: 1 Cor 1:16, Acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also Acts 11:14.  It is known for sure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an infant: St. Polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his martyrdom).  St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as infants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus's "Against Heresies", and in Tertullian's "On Baptism".  All these so far mentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord's death.  After that, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.
: My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones.

Any help is deeply appreciated. (Advice, referral to literature, : etc...) :  : Thank you, :  : Dave Carvell First off, I would consider the severity of the pain. I had stones several years ago, and there's now way I could have made it without heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the hospital. I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would dissolve them. If the stones are passible, the best thing she could do is drink LOTS of water, and hope that they pass, but every time they move a little, the pain will be excrutiating. I was told by my doctor at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (Yes, by a male doctor, so I'm sure some of you women will disagree). I'd really like to know the truth in this, so maybe some of you women who have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in.  -- Jeff Silva (707) 577-2681

It reflects a common perception that people have about fundamentalists being strict disciplinarians. Whether or not this perception is justified is another issue.

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among  21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This  report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital  Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years.       Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been  collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center  for Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were  abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484  participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior  cesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national  estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged  after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were  calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from  national vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of  cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based  solely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at  the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value  of 1.96.       In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as  in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean  rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no  previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5.  In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05)  higher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast  (22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years  than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or  government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger  hospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other  private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of  payment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries.       Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women  increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained  the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3,  essentially the same as the 23.5 observed.       Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated  338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary  cesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been  performed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean  delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991,  35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e.,  failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal  distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications.       The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In  comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days,  and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC  deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3  days). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for  primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and  non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively.  Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center  for Health Statistics, CDC.  1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates  have been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that  maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because  cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of  childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the  overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary  cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8).       Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections  -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries  than for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for  cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in  1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and  $4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes  $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean  rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number  of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000),  resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital  charges.       Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may  impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean  delivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women  offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7).  Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7)  --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely  offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data)  was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all  women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was  attempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the  VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary  rate.       One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by  applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean  delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review  process (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates  include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing  reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of  physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public  awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns,  which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean  delivery (4).

Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents  stationed overseas generally has been low, this risk varies substantially and  unpredictably. During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of  State (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases  among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the  health records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27  cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June  1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and  CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and  identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This  report summarizes the results of the investigation.       Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were  available for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if  the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide- confirmed as having malaria.       A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to  obtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria  chemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets  and insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long  sleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey,  128 (82%) responded.       Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in  Kampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less  than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15  years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk  RR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the  cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years,  compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the  Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for  malaria.       Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who  participated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine  alone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were  not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly  lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88  9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37  24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported  side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason.       The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely  used bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was  also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening  (0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0;  upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with  failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the  evening.       As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel  the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis  regimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection  measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to  provide window and door screens for all personnel.

The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and  continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in  malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for  short-term travelers to such areas.       Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most  other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas  (e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In  Africa, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in  preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and  well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk  for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis  (e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000  users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness,  gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for  other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1).       Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need  for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen  (3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense  chloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for  persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil  is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be  used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P.  falciparum has not been reported.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and  pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the  United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than  90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these  organisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely  recommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined  vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate  injections.       The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products  for vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b  conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for  vaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus  toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine  (TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in  vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease.                                 ActHIB Trademark       On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T),  manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB  Trademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This  vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary  vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously  unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months  apart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one  dose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all  children. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive  a single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving  a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4,  and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b  polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to  that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed  Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in  prospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early  because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 for use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease  were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and  other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to  that of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark       On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus  toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl  River, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL  Registered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and  Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis  Biologics, Inc. Rochester, New York).       This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years  for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when  indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody  responses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark  is expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus,  and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other  DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines.       The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that  all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b  conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12- 15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose  primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2,  4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A  complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and  TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.

The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah  Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of  California, San Francisco.  An international steering committee and scientific  program committee provided guidance.       The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including  Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United  States and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National  Institute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National  Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research,  and the Procter and Gamble Company.       Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics,  professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision  of oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and  mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and  women's issues.                                  Recommendations      Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association  between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to  establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for  more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology  studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral  lesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions.                                   Epidemiology      Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV  Infection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 radically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely  in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.   Today, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in  children and adolescents.       While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a  major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.   Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more  are appearing all the time.       Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions  such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore  the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression  and prognosis.                              Social/political Issues      Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection  focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for  indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health  care delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public  about what AIDS is, and how it is acquired.                            Saliva and Salivary Glands      Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory  activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary  secretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular  secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid  secretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible  for salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect  of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both  promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2)  direct effects on the virus or target cells.       Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease  in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity.                                 Pediatric Issues      Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With  early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV- infected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from  mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's  sero-status is known prior to giving birth.

Recommendations made at  the workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of  diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration  of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy.                         Occupational and Treatment Issues      Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals  and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command  considerable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit  of HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection  and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the  treatment of HIV-infected patients.       Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on  the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.   Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence  Company in late 1993. --------- end of part 1 ------------ ---

I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a 20mg dose didn't work. Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some.  Now I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than Prozac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft have to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'm having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next. My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin drugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't work at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine. >...suggestions as to the next step?

I heard a short blurb on the news yesterday about an herb called feverfew (?) that some say is good for preventing migraines. I think the news said there were two double-blind studies that found this effective. Does anyone know about these studies? Or have experience with feverfew? I'm skeptical, but open to trying it if I can find out more about this. What is feverfew, and how much would you take to prevent migraines (if  this is a good idea, that is)? Are there any known risks or side effects of feverfew?  Thanks in advance for any info! Brenda

I'm personally expecting Moog.  Blue played fairly decent (alright spectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but Moog has the experience. What Did Blue have going for him, nothing, What would happen in a Tie game, the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out (at the very least until your team scores)  Blue didn't face that kind of pressure on Tuesday.  The Bruins will come out storming that is for sure.  I really think that this series is up to Buffalo, Boston (except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad ,  As a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting.

Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy, the possible complications from a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery. The risks of surgery, anyway, are minimal. Unless they are exceedingly large, hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia.  Don't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction. And the smaller the hernia is, the higher the chances that a loop of bowel will become incarcerated or strangulated. =============================== Howard Doyle

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of other religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and the story was quite detailed).

I looked at that Bimmer yesterday. It's an '81, has about 90kmi, according to owner (odometer stopped working at 68Kmi). Drivess well, sounds good, body is OK, he wants $3000. i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary driver on this one, and she wants auto. The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!) The A/C seems to have a leak.  The sunroof is sticky, but operational. Odometer does not work, as mentioned before. Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm. Wipers are slow. That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator,  rotors and calipers, exhaust. The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange stories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that, although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking  it to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it. So, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust. I know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody remembers what issue? Mike.S

	of Denver for the Denver community.  The University has neither 	control over nor responsibility for the opinions of users. Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire will start small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature in the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches fire at once.   This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports that the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed by those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, and broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but was really one big fire.   Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas. When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them to escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room.   I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final assault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show their agents of the the FBI overcoming the "forces of evil", aka the Branch Davidians.  The tapes would also allow the FBI to prove that they were not using excessive force.   -- Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substitute Boulder, CO                    | for brains is silence. satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      |

Habital planets are also dependent on what kind of plant life can be grown.. and such.. Length of growing season (that is if you want something more than VAT food, argh, Id ratehr eat an MRE for  along period of time). I know in Fairbanks (Furbanks to some) the winter can get to -60 or so F, but in the summer can get to +90 and such.. I know of worse places..         Incans and Sherpa and other low pressure atmosphere and such are a limit in human adaptability(someone mentioend that Incan woman must come to lower elevations to have babies brought to term? true?) I remember a book by Pourrnelle I think that delt with a planet was lower density air.. I wonder what the limit on the other end of atmospheres? I am limiting to human needs and stresses and not alien possibilties.. Thou aliens might be more adapted to a totally alien to human environment, such as the upper atmosphere of Jupiter or??

As far as Cheveldae is concerned, he is a decent goalie.  The most logical trade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers.  I'm sure if Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his roots in Detroit.  He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps the Rangers could get a Zombo in return?  Beezer got a few good years in him and the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.

>My mother has been advised to have a bone scan performed?  What is this >procedure for, and is it painful?  She's been having leg and back pain >which her GP said was sciatica.  Her oncologist listened to her symptoms >and said that it didn't sound like sciatica, and she should get a bone >scan.  Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer?  I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist. A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given intravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein.  After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high  concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it. As far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line. What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system. I hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother's care.  I'm a newly graduated nurse, and I enjoy sharing information with other people to help them understand things that they did not know about before. My thoughts are with you both.

Idea for repair of satellites: Warning I am getting creative again: Why not build a inflatable space dock. Basically deploy one side of the space dock (using a scissor shaped structure, saw it on beyond 2000), then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it.. The inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to be non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat), thenheat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit, but a much striped down own)..  I know this might take a slot of work or not??? Or just to plain wierd, but ideas need to be thought of, for where is tomorrow, but in the imagination of the present.. ==

    Jim Haynes wants to know the following is a scam....        There's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping        mall, offering free examinations.  Part of the process involves a        multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer-        sounding voice "digitize left PSIS" "digitize right PSIS" "digitize        C7" "please stand with spine in neutral position".  I'm wondering        whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voice        is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring something        that chiropractors think is useful to measure. Earth to sci.med....If it looks like a duck...and quacks like a duck...... This is a TOTAL scam. Since the beginning of chiropraxis, the chiropractor has  tried to sell The Subluxation as The Problem and then sell themselves and their Adjustments as The Solution. The Chiropractic Subluxation is a delusional  diagnosis and the Adjustments of Subluxations by extension constitute a  delusional medicine. The wide spectrum of chiropractic Techniques ALL have their own methods for  detecting Spinal Demons and unique methodolgies for Excorcizing Them. The  computer approach is an attempt to 'sell with science' but this device is  nothing more than a 'high-tech' Subluxation Detector.....and in the end... AMAZINGLY...it will show the potential 'patient' to suffer from...VS...... Vertebral Subluxation....The Silent Killer! John Badanes, DC, CA

I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, >even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the 'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal. I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that, just because it has changed the way we strive. BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.  Sometimes they make it better. -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\ As the radius of vision increases, -------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs" and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least, that is what i was taught.

But why not turn the question around, why are automatics so common in the US? My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torque-rich V8's in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to  use both feet to depress, and that this has just lived on. And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches later on.  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably know BMW's are not cheap to fix either.  The owner sounds like a shady character just trying to take advantage of someone. Sure $ 3000 sounds good but you should calculate how much the repairs will be. It sounds like you would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more. Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned. Who knows how many miles are on it and how it was driven.  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear. For all you know it could have 200,000 miles on it.  The thing you have to remember is that this isn't the last 528i around either. Just wait and keep shopping. For around $ 5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better, needs less repair, and has legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering. Take it from a guy who has been taken a couple of times. Good luck. Al Himsl

Problem is, I will have to be _proven_ wrong. > >In mentioning some nonsense about psychology :) and atheism, Bob Muir asks >the following question.    No smiley on the part about atheism, I see. Do you realize that your statement says that I was mentioning "nonsense" about atheism? This is hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making, as you have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the first. Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it out of hand.  But, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be misinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not mean to call my statements about atheism "nonsense"? If so, care to back up that claim? >>	Do I sound "broken" to you? > >I answer in the affirmative. OK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I "broken"? >Is it politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group >permitted the luxury of arrogance?    *YAWN* Excuse me, I don't recall any portion of my post in which I called Christians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity "silly" and then following that up with information that I was nine years old when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's existence. I define "faith" as "belief in the absense of any proof", BTW. Also, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types there, so in answer to your question: "no." Finally, I'd hardly call Christianity "beseiged" in this country. I seldom see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, of course, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happening is my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people who claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't practiced by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians.  >Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting >atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?   The implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I'm not a student of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and Linguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications I see are improper, please let me know. I'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_ think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see "atheist" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve your respect? Aw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high, here. It's just that the "nonsense" thing really annoys me. I figure you should see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to your question. Now, the smoothed feather version: I seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I am looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of Christian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view. I've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't know the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists I figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want (hence the "amatuer" psychology crack), but without an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive.        I'm hoping people really want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I actually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only "broken" people are atheist. 	Try it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they  discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't follow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous mix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions so successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which  "breaks" people. It's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another reason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as  a watchdog for logical fallacies :). >I have a  >difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >about the subject.       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything about Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my reaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that atheists are "broken", hostile people. This post confirms that someone else believes it.  > >Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says                                               ^^^^^^^^^^ >he will need to be proven wrong about it.  Well, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of evidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies lack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a "seeker" if you like, I don't.  _Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say "I don't believe in any god" rather than my position: "I believe that no god(s) exist." For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve, because they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is confusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and Methodists from an atheist point of view :). This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in something (followed up by "everyone has faith in something"). Guess what? My atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is that really too much to ask? >Well, I don't even waste my time trying.  Well, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why the supposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is it because you yourself are unconvinced? :)  > I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it. And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how. I have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm "broken"? I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you think. All I ask for is proof of the assertion "God exists". Logical or physical proofs only, please. Then we'll discuss the nature of "God". >In response, he tells me he will say an "atheist's prayer" for me.  Prayer?! Uh, oh, we'll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :) >Good luck, Bob.  And, best regards. Good luck to you, as well.

Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeable ones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain. One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old). Otherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans. She then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked until four years ago). Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are the chances for full remission/recovery?

One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark.  The leaves contain either no or less saffrole than the bark.

I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which is claimed to have the saffrole removed. > I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to > commercially produce/sell food with carcinogenic substances, it is not illegal > for people to do such to their own food (smoking, etc).  Is this true? Well, the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make  root beer, there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human consumption. Also, when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen bark, she made a point of telling me that I couldn't buy sassafras for human  consumption. I find the fact that some people reckless enough to step into an automobile live in fear of dropping dead because of a pork rib quite funny, in a sick way.

There are at least two meanings of the word "once".  1) only one time, and 2) at some other time (i.e. once upon a time).  Note that in the previous verse, the word "once" is used with the second meaning, and also in the following verse, "once" is again used with the second meaning. The Greek, I am sure, uses different words for each of the two meanings for the English word "once".  I am not a Greek scholar, but I'm sure someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning.

...... >  > No Koresh is responsible. >  > If a murderer goes on the rampage it is the murderer who is responsible. > The police may bear responsiblity for failing to stop him but the primary > responsibility is with the murderer. >  When did Koresh go on a rampage? What I saw was an unnecessary, unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th. Probably even an illegal action by ATF, certainly way out of proportion to anything reasonable. And yet, according to a pole taken yesterday, 95% of the people poled believe the government forces acted appropriately.  They don`t believe Reno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack. I suppose they also believed things like: "I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget." "We don`t need to lead with a tax increase...." "It starts with a middle-class tax cut..." "I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll have a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history." "I will ask congress for a line item veto.." "I will lift the social security earnings test.." I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves right, rather than the other way around.  That way I have a better than 50% chance of being right about my first guess! Read the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens and their rights.  I am sick of the abuse of government power. As Tom Jefferson said: "When all government,..., shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated."

Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome >had already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should >not be based on citations from these ALONE. Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth. They should remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I, Jerome did not hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon, and quoted them as Scripture in his later writings.  And as I have already pointed out, in a previous letter on this subject, the Catholic Church has accepted the deuterocanon from the beginning.  And the Protestants in the 1500's all of a sudden revived the old theory of some, condemned by Pope, Council, and Church, that the deuterocanon were not inspired. Again, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the unbelieving Jews, drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD, in countering the Christian use of the Septuagint.                 ^^^^^ Andy Byler
Subject: ****CHRISTIANITY IN CRISIS**** by Hank Hanegraaff                        "CHRISTIANITY IN CRISIS"                                     by: Hank Hanegraaff          "Controversy for the sake of controversy is a sin.             Controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command."                                        -Dr. Walter Martin Dr. Walter Martin personally selected Hank Hanegraaff to succeed him as President of the Christian Research Institute -- the largest  evangelical counter-cult organization in the world. In this skillful,  careful treatment of an explosive subject, Hanegraaff documents and  examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly  compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian  faith. For the first time ever, this large and influential movement is legitimately labeled as cultic. In this book, Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith  movement as E.W. Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of "another gospel"  (Gal 1:6-9) (Kenneth E. Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, Frederick K.C. Price, John Avanzini, Robert Tilton, Marilyn Hickey, Paul (David)  Yonggi Cho, Charles Capps, Jerry Savelle, Morris Cerullo, and Paul and  Jan Crouch). The book is now available through Harvest House Publishers and should be in most Christian Book Stores soon. You can order a hard-back copy  through CRI for $14.99 by calling 1-800-443-9797 and avoid retail  mark-ups. The Christian Research Journal, which is a quarterly publication by CRI  has an article in it's most recent issue just released called, "What's  Wrong With The Word Faith Movement?" This is a good article that will  inform you of each of the teachers above, and tide you over until your  book arrives. If you are interested in receiving the Journal yourself,  you can order it from CRI at the number above for $14 a year. It is the  best source of the most-accurate and well-researched info in Christiandom  today. [If we're going to have a discussion of book here (and this is the third posting so far), I'd like people to say enough about its contents for people to decide whether it's worth reading.  --clh]
"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently,  often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality... but the context really isn't that important. My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not. Hate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not  something is a sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the  stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so  strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and  do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even  believe what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build love. In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our  neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he  commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians supposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We need to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love  with theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to love someone is to pray for them.  - Scott --  This is my signature. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and  checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the     compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.    This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the  six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world     since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's  phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.     They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what     was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors. Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air, driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to  find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.   Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of  propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house, it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked  together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others died groping in the blackness. Frank

[To the moderator: I posted this about a week ago but it never showed                    up (locally) on the net.  If this has already                    actually been posted, please fill free to flush                    this copy.  --N] >Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of >the Acts of the Apostles can be found? 1] A english translation of this can be found in:    "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an    introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson    (London, 1923). 2] Another work that might be useful is:    "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and    Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;    reprinted 1970). (This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it actually contains an english translation or not.) 3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:    "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in    Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966). 4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.) 5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:    "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible    Society, 1971). Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts). In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:    "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full    report (with an English translation) of the several additions and    other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...    Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the    text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the    evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272). >I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has >this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the >differences are between the long and the short forms. 6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is usually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources). 7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition (mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%. 8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if you prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail. 9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the Alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.

Subject: '93 Hyundai Sonata...Opinions/Info Wanted I'd like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata.  I know Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that have them swear by them.  They also haven't had the problems with them that Consumer Reports claims.  I haven't driven one yet.  I have driven a '93 Hyundai Elantra (which Consumer Reports also trashed) and was very impressed with it.  The local Hyundai dealership ("no-haggle" policy) is offering an Elantra GLS w/ power moonroof for $13163.  They also have a Sonata base, w/ Sunroof for $13997.  I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w/ sunroof and 4-spd automatic.  I'll decide which engine I prefer after test driving both the 4-cyl and the V6.  The Sonata is also offering a $1500 rebate.  Hmmm, that's another question.  Is the following scenario the appropriate manner to handle "negotiation"? 1.  make offer 2.  subtract rebate from offer 3.  talk trade 4.  subtract trade from offer to get final price --  FiberCom, Inc., P.O.

    A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland     on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous     pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near     Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part     was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They     were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became     enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle     of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby     forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were     visible till morning sunrise.     The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in     Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in     the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was     only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.     A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a     spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about     five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the     upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop     became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of     the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright     spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails     were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still     visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.     The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if     there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near     Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969     we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of     these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium     experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we     have observed 17 satellite launches.

But    what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid    baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores    to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and     football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid    basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that    was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during    the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..    I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN. Hope things improve    by next season...

I still can't understand all the hype about the Impalla SS, it STILL has the ugly Caprice body (Orca on wheels).  The Caprice was the worst new body style to come out of Detroit EVER! Now just because the LT1 engine and a few suspension tweeks are being added. Its STILL UGLY, its STILL a BARGE.  GM's answer to everything is "throw in a V8 and someone will buy it."  Or "add some plastic ground affects and a few stickers and call it a GT, GTZ or SS, and someone will buy it." IMHO GM needs to scrap the Caprice body COMPLETELY and start over with a BLANK sheet of paper.  No minor modification (wheel well treatments, tail amp modification, or nose re-design or even the LT1 engine) will help the existing Caprice. Jeff

NO.  I hate to repeat myself Jim, but like I told Joe, I was not attempting in any way to justify gun control.  You're right, any death is serious. THAT was my point to Joe who said that "anti-gunners" try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem.  I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a problem. No, I don't want to discuss match control.  I don't equate a book of matches to a loaded 9 millimeter either.  Don't confuse the issue.  And please don't say that tired old NRA line "Guns don't kill people, people kill people". Sure, people can kill people without guns.  But easy access to guns makes it a lot more convenient.

I'm not saying if that is a good thing or not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program, they say "well no..."  So, in answer to your question, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test evaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police are essentially saying "look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't want it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community". If you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.   >> >> >>I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or >> >>brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135,000 youths) are >> >>obtained easily and quickly, through a personal friend, or more often >> >>"borrowed" from a parent without their knowledge. >> > >> >I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these "statistics" - I >> >suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of >> >students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun) >> >to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students >> >who carry a gun to school daily. >> > >>  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence >> or the Centers for Disease Control.

For myself, as a Catholic, I see my own opposition to capital punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion - a reverence for life. Here in the UK, the anti-abortion case is often let down by the explicit link which those on the political left make with anti-abortionists and pro-executionists. There is a tendency to condemn people who hold both views as hypocrites. I feel that if there were many more anti-abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition to capital punishment on a pro-life line, it would end this kneejerk association of anti-abortion as a right-wing thing, and get many to think seriously about the issue (there are plenty who are pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wing reason). I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken as support for capital punishment. I take it that as a Roman Catholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsider it wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by "authority". Matthew Huntbach

Cross-posted to talk.politics.guns from can.politics: # >been to Waco, Texas lately? yes, the government takes care of us # >all, doesn't it? as long as you belong to a government-sanctioned # >religion. # # Excuse me, but didn't these gun-ladden cult members threaten, shoot and kill # some people? They threatened no one.  Their neighbours thought they were a little strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live next door to. One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  If this is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof that these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defend themselves. : Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me : they *realy* belong in society ... If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it is not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  The people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI is claiming that the 'cult' started the fire. 'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but I'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say about it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same. Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident: 1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing     an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least     three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify     a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as     uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to     be police.      2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:     + "We only had handguns" - the original footage showed 4 BATF       officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5       assault sub-machine gun.     + "We were out gunned" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the       BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you       have the best guns available for the job.     + "We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!" -       this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot       through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that       matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and       *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly       incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are       shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter       plywood.     + "We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.        No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.        Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.        Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers."       - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily       and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.        3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one     of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would     mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did     AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh? All in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be taken with a grain or two of salt.

Before becoming a Christian I too had problems when I asked one to explain it to me...The actual evidence is not always what you see on a person's  outside. It should be but is not always. 	A very specific, somewhat miraculous example of the truth of God working to help His followers is soemthing that happened to me. For nearly 4 years after an accident I had severe complications from a triple  fracture in my left leg and surgery--pins put in, then removed. The bone  itself was perfectly healed. No infectoin that could be detected. Yet I  was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and bluish. More complicatios developed in my other leg, none of which could be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te northern Illinois region. We went everywhere--no one could explain it. Durin gthat summer (June 19, 1991 to be exact) I gave my life and heart to Christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life (which i never really had anyway) because of what he did for me on the cross and the  fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it. I was facing the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair (I was confined to one in  order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems were unknown, had been in it for about 2 1/2 months before that day). 	I found it ore than coincidental that less than 2 weeks after I put my faith where my mouth was, one more in the long line of doctors and not even an orthopeodic specialist, diagnosed my problems with no difficulty, set me on the path to an effective cure, and I was walking and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for 4 years. The diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have "overlooked" because it was perfectly obvious from my test results. 	Maybe this doesn't hit you as miraculous. But to me it really is. Imagine an active 17 year old being told she may not be able to walk mcuh longer...and is now a happy 18 year old who can dance and run knowing that the problem was there all along and was "revealed" just after she did what she knew was right. As the song says... 	"Our God is an awesome God...."

Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list:			 In a discussion between me and Chris Lerch, the subject of Springfield's  1st round upset of the Providence Bruins came up. Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL  hierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices for the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL. Furthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup  finals between Roch and Spring, that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office and that: "...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and staff attending all games with the Springfield brass, including sitting in their box for the game in Springfield and, according to the Rochester media, openly cheering for Springfield." Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true. I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the Wings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises questions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership.

Does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of a man's vasectomy on his female partner? I've seen plenty of study results about vasectomy's effects on men's health, but what about women?  For example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for, say, cervical cancer?

Mail bounced, so... >i am in the process of buying a new auto.  i haven't decided yet whether >i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new >auto purchase. Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it  yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing. >i know that the "blue book" value for the car is $2825. I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can  get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself. Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It  might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for 6 months for the best price). >an acquaintence >has offered to give me blue book value for the car. I don't know what you mean by "an acquaintance" but I would make darn sure that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  That's probably a safer approach than selling to a private party. --    -- Alan                        # Mountain Dew and doughnuts...    ..!ames!elroy!alan          # because breakfast is the most important meal
>Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge >of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can >determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge >of the all-sky map's accuracy.  PR material for the other three instruments >give accuracies on the order of "fractions of a degree", if that's  >any help. But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  The other x three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the  resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of  the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the  differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors. Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small  component to the positional error.   Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would  require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort  cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together  now: "Parallax ARc SECond", a parsec is the distance of an object  that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line). If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to  have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline. The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from. -Kevin

> >	I loved the ABC coverage. The production was excellent. The appearance Antonio,you weren't alone. ABC ratings were very good. I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were at 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion from local sports teams. Quite frankly, I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happy to be proven wrong! Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game... ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis. Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.

Having read in the past about the fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft, I had assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function.  However I always find disturbing the oxymoron of a "NO-OP" command that does something. If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not a "NO-OP" command. Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has nothing to do with jet propulsion. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BNR Ltd.     |  bnrgate.bnr.ca!bcars5!jcobban         |  FAX:   (613) 763-2626
Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and relaunching it: There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet. I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due to thermal cycle stresses...) I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are much less so.)

Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes.  New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at           800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research           Institutes.    LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing  and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal, Radiology.    Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes.  By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testing for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.    In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.    "We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding, "this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain."    Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.    Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.    "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we consider this test a major advancement in medicine," said Bruce Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher and a co-author of the study.    Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats, Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley, R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States, and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.    For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology May issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.    Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:    What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?    Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality, loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.    How many people does it affect?    Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.    What are its signs and symptoms?    Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulness" caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" and suggests the following criteria:    -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is       normal.    -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.    -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.    -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.    Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.  -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical  trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal  candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the  frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the  candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus  should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the  intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to  oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the  lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really  amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out. The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all  conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if  conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard  medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very  important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria  after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason  to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply  and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).

Additionally, there might be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden landing.  Finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination  problems if the instruments came back to earth. Of course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid something that might be done in one shuttle launch.  Here's hoping Cepi's gang gets the job done right the first time.

>Here's one from the mill.  The Oilers MIGHT move to Hamilton >where Porklington can get a free deal. > The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere. Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his "last" stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial government is months away from a provincial election...it is the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price... and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing. Pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them. He can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his price if Edmonton doesn't. Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and surrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks. It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing. However, in this case, about the long-term financial viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically  right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money. Sather has done his job...the Oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon (Al Strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in Canada in a post-mortem of the Oilers season in the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me.)

: As the subject says, I am moving from Mass. to Calif. and will be driving : mostly on Interstate 80. : Any advice from folks who have done it before? - Plan your gas stops in major-city areas to avoid the 25 cent-per-gallon "only gas station for 50 miles and you're an out-of-towner" surcharge. - Prepare your car.  Don't forget things like your fuel & air filters.  If you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff just in case of a flat.  In my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the California desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to the tire. - If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft. - McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms. - invest in a $30 CB & magnetic roof antenna.  It may help if you're stranded, and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc. - Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a new state, to catch all the speeders who have "escaped" the previous state. - Same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of 65mph rural interstate -=$>Dave<$=- --  NYNEX Science & Technology, 500 Westchester Ave, White Plains, NY 10604

I'll pick up that PM and have a look -- maybe the picture in there is not the actual car, but a prototype?

Maybe they'll work on the design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking '95 or '96.  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design, e.g. the F-body Camaro/Firebirds (btw, the new Camaros look like shit too). --  Keath Milligan, Software Engineer, VideoTelecom Corporation, Austin, Texas -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Try Real/Time Communications!

hi all, Ive applied for the class of 93 at quite a number of schools (20) and have gotten 13 rejects, 4 interviews and 3 no responses. Any one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters? According to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out the number of their class in acceptances by mid March. Whats going on... I am losing my sanity checking my mailbox every day. Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i kind of looked into Chiropractic and Podiatry but they really dont interest me.

Why can't an aircraft be designed so that the pilot can always be  maintained in a upright position, perpendicular to the plane of acceleration?  With the visual helmets now being used that display some of the flight parameters and with a keyboard and manuvering equipment moving with the pilot, a pilot may be able to function at accelerations in excess of 12G.  Is anyone currently pursuing this area or is there a reason why this is impossible at the present time? --

The following was published in the May 15th Rocky Mountain News.  I guess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this church.  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor.  I also understand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately, this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is perceived to approach. There is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any cost' style of theology.  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits into this equation? Baptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springs told they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious rite. By Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau Colorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured to a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a Baptist minister. Doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by their parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the Cornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight, free balloons, squirt guns and candy. Before that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked into a room for religious instruction and told they should be baptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or their families are not of the Baptist faith. The baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including Paulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls who were baptized without her knowledge or consent. 'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's a false pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the minister told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not baptized. Cornerstone church officials defended their actions. 'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded us to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Bible where it says that parental permission is required before a child is baptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist Church. Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized because 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said. Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children to a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were members of the Cornerstone Church. Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the children, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action. ------------------------------------------- Aren't these the same behaviors we condemn in the Hari Krishnas and other cults? [I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account mentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is absolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because of the clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insisted on being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willing to do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrant much careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so much parental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether you believe in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign of entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from *somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of the Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is likely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from a baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he would be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already has been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he get rebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's being robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith. --clh]

The shock sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have on my other car.

If someone could pry  > them up gently enough, then they could bypass the alarm. The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without setting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false alarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's cause and it was not a false alarm. >  > I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl > underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm. >  I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't have one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply. > Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that > supposedly detects people approcahing the car.... >  This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at this feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter. I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on. Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to people as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back.  The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind. >  > I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems > and about the viper in general. >  I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune it to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable the chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the alarm is armed/disarmed.   I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine flashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest. > The car is an 89 Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape! >  >  > Ron Garnett >  I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor.  The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle) than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good value for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is.  Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only.  Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they had in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?> Merrill

My apologies for the typo - I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the first period and the Leafs none.   As well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they were calling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings. Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to "make up for it" takes a lot away from what could have been a great game. --

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What these people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today. It is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented on both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programming approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis  capability. Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great idea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak on the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation studies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  There are tons of applications, with the ability to create "virtual" instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With the addition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station, allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial I/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control software for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach. Dennis, University of Alabama in Huntsville

Hi Folks,               Last year America bought two  "Hall Generators" which are used as thrusters for space vehicles from former USSR,if I could recall correctly these devices were sent to JPL,Pasadena labs for testing and evaluation.                     I am just curious to know  how these devices work and what what principle is involved .what became of them.There was also some controversy that the Russian actually cheated,sold inferior devices and not the one they use in there space vehicles. Any info will be appreciated...   ok   {                         Thank{ in advance... Tamoor A Zaidi Lockheed Commercial Aircraft Center Norton AFB,San Bernardino

A big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider (active) homosexuality a sin.  I don't often see the attitude of "forgive me and I will try to change".  Instead I see "there's nothing wrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you who have an illness because you don't accept me".  Christians can and will accept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner. Sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  I was born with a desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning.  It's much less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out in anger.

Look, folks, I don't know what happened in Waco.  I do not claim the BDs are   angels, I never did.  Koresh may very well be the devil incarnate.  I just   don't know.  But I do know that I must question any single source of   information, such as we have here.  And I must question even harder given that   it is single source at the insistance of that very government.  What ever else   happened at WACO, that is perhaps the biggest evil done.  And even more so in   light of the discrepencies turning up between the federal officials and the   state officials. But what I really don't understand is the hoards of devoted government   worshipers who believe the government could not possibly do any wrong.  They   are fanatic to the point of making things up, such as Brent's microwave oven   disclaim of the BD's using fire for food heating.   I am hard pressed to see any real difference between the claimed power Koresh   held over the BDs, and the demonstrated power the government holds over those   rapid apologists.

First, unless that round is chambered there is little threat of penetration by the bullet, or the brass for that matter.

Finally, it's rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to a crisp.  See, by the time the ammunition went up those people were quite dead.  Look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising. 	However, it's my contention that it makes little difference whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the Feds seem to have shared responsibility for both. <  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

Jerome only translated the >apocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead >body' that it was included in the catholic canon. As I have written time and again, the Hebrew canon was fixed in Jamnia, Palestine, in 90 AD.  60 years after the foundation of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.  Furthermore, the opinons of Jerome do not count.  He was neither the Church, or the Pope, or an ecumenical council, or a council in general, or an insturment of the Magisterium of the Church.  He was a private individual, learned admittedly, but subject to erro of opinion.  And in exlcuding the deuterocanon, he erred, as Pope Damsus, and the Council of Carthage, and the tradition of the Fathers, clearly shows, as I pointed out in my previous post. >How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the >words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to >them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. >And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will >take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the >holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) I suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement, if you want to take it in the sense you are taking it, that taking away from the book will cause you to lose heaven. >It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude.

The order of the Canon is unimportant, it is the content that matters.  None of Jesus' statments exlcude the deuterocanon, which were interspersed throughout the canon.  And remeber, there are some completely undisputed books, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiatses, Song of Songs, Job, etc. that are not quoted in the New Testament, which is not taken as prejudicial to their being inspired.

You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means >you can think of to do so. I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for  homosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of  bestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask  this gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences?   What happened to "No doubt I am free to do anything"?  I think you have a  serious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between  homosexuality and bestiality as "slimey" and "sleazy", you are making an  implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting,  unnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about  homosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any  sincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even  have their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them  all of being mere "jokers"? I notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only  Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical  prohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament  passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none  that condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian  homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any "clear" New Testament  statements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian  zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament  makes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all? I am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically  acceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply  the same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well.  If  the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual  preferences as well, I'm going to apply them and see what comes up.  I'm not  trying to "torpedo a serious issue" by using what you label "a ridiculous  joke".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines  for Christian sexuality, and I don't think such a question is "irrelevant" in a  group called "soc.religion.christian".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and  bestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good  precedent for doing the same. >Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length, >the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to >love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ- >ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get >in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues. I don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a  side issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging  people to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine  whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New  Testament that "God has joined together" heterosexual couples, and that the  marriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual  intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under  the Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards  of defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the  sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don't think it's  right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to  Christians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't.   That was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different  examples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong  to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians.  >Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every >corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same >old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never >even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with >the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can >manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great >emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even >taking the trouble to find out what it is. It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don't  get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual  orientation; I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar  attitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with  child abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of "clear" NT  condemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation  (or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on  alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation. >Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ. >WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to >condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN >to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor? >God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or >condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in >insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are >SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do. >  >Why, for God's sake? > [quote from John 3:17ff omitted for brevity] This is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere  rhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the  answer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you  yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find  bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in  connection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply  all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply  them to homosexuals? Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at  the thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of  homosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially  unacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.   Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual  morality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible  condemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality  than it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality  with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer  this question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many  people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality. Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely  pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that  the Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think  adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love  my neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and  unmentionable, are you disobeying "repeated orders not to judge or condemn  others"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you  and judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same  offense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible  brands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God? >For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from >evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and >rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* >show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits >have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified. > >However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity; >and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who >fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow >it with the darkness of false witness against us. >--  >Michael L. Siemon               I say "You are gods, sons of the >    - or -                      you shall die like men, and fall I'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus  is the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I  agree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our  salvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us,  and we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ's grace mean that those  who refer to sin as "sin" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking  in general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible  calls something "sin", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it  sin too. As applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on  Christian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible  says on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every  verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and "unclear" at best.   The most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some  dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as  condemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most  positive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that  some verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That's it.  Jesus declared all foods  clean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to  keep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from  being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian  practice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination  that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you  have some verses which are at best "not clear" but which some people believe  *are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum  total of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse. I can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything  simple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and  those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your  case as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don't believe it says  anything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving  one another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is  it?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for  Christians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.   Therefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.   Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still  left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about  homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who  are under the law and those who are not. - Mark [Actually I don't think the reaction to the comparision with bestiality is based on bestialophobia.  I think what he regards as slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and bestiality.  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical approach to the Law.  They regard all of Lev as not binding on Christians.  The argument is that there's no way in the text to separate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics.  This does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nor does it mean that they accept bestiality.  It simply means that their sexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not from Lev.  --clh]

The Oriental Orthodox Churches never even "shelter" Eutyches (the advocator of Monophysitism) but on the contrary, it condemned (and still does condemn) him and his heresy. That is why the Eastren (Chalcedonian) Orthodox Church held talks with the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago and still continueing till today, but they have converged on many issues the most imporatant of which is Christology (I have more  details of the inter-Orthodox dialogue, in case anyone is interested). So I do not see how the "Alexandrians" and the Nestorians are in a similar position.

[...] B >  Marty B.  Marty, I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article   on kidney stones as gospel. First of all, I would want to know who  sponsored that study.  I have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years from  local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the  bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us  compliments of the Dairy Industries.  There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive  financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous   benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.  Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved   in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study  didn't say that, it only claimed that "most kidney stones are large-  ly calcium."  Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact  opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they  are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.    Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still   the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention   of kidney stones.  I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in  one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney  stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE  in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium  type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit  from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone  progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection.  The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is  released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent  effective. "This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent  pregnancy," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "As an injectable,  given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to  missing a daily dose." Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and  clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive  protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the  injections. As with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and  risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional  before making a decision to use it. Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive  studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies  in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo  Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive. The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In  addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain,  dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have  acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood  clots in the legs, lungs or eyes. The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the  drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this  potential effect. Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for  contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich.,  which will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive  Injection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s.  At that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause  breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer,  including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.

"These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious  illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would  otherwise be possible," said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. "The effort  to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and  indeed a hallmark of this administration."  These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to  approve a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. They apply when the  drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such  endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in  themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified  scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient.  Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval  earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or  prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used.  The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and  effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established.  The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct  postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate  endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness.  One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a  model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the  cause of AIDS.  Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that  a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used  safely only under a restricted distribution plan.  "The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process  without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight," said FDA  commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "While drug approval will be accomplished  faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and  effectiveness standards required by law."

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that  certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can  prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The  degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of  visual impairment       This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of  the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose  their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug  treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million  Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and  100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease  that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo  surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas.       The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa)  Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye  Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas  Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge  Yancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an  exclusive license for this research from UCSF.      In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to  assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring  substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week.  Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their  photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light  exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic  Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing  unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and  Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments.       Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of  Clinical Research, said, "BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that  have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment,  and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF  could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached  surgically."       "Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the  retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases  to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope  that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression  and preserve useful vision throughout life," stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D.,  Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness.       In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in  conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for  peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy,  motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By  itself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral  sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease).       Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a  leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for  the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve  injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and  Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.

These findings, according to  investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have  serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing  countries.       "This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and  have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the  importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body  weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing  countries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator Dr.  William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid  metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University.       Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the  food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while  simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.   These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra  Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have  coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary  heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is  virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name  Tarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on  "kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more  while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.      The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas,  and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water,  together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras  also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains  approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69  percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator  in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while  low in cholesterol and fat.      The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL,  low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density  lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values  are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated  cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993 disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the  Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although  able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL- cholesterol.       Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria  Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school  building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food  was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the  investigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food  stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly,  and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for  cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements  included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.   Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were  fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet.       "In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40  percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that  many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in  fiber," elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in  the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian  Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  "The CSI is a single number that  incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in  the diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol  level, particularly the LDL," Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet  averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's "affluent" diet used in the study  ranks a CSI of 149.       The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of  establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before  exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating  dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or  plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat  and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  "You  must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put  into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not  discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease  because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on  a plateau," Dr. Connor says.       After 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects' mean plasma  cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL  fraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent,  and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride  levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in  weight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon,  yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35  days.  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993      The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized  nations.  "We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount  of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic  study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary  cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.   In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total  calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects  the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary  cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased  quite a bit in this study," Dr. Connor explains.      Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of  coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of  fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because  of their usual high fat intake.       Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20  percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI  around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in  meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent  suggestions that Americans adopt a "Mediterranean-style" diet.  "The original  Mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of  fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of  meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to  olive oil is not going to help the situation."       The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the  emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies  undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart  disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different  diet than the average citizen.  "If the pattern of afluence increases, the  entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease,  which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the  developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can  concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public  health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for  unnecessary, expensive medical technology," Dr. Connors says.      "The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move  their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a  very short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary  heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years  ago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly," he concludes.

From what I understand from Dr. Frank Six of the Marshall Space Flight Center there is no insrmountable problem in bringing HST back. IT was designed that way to begin with. Also it is my understanding that the solar arrays WILL be one of the items replaced on this mission. The originals were built by Brit Aerospace and I think the new ones are too.

Okay, okay, I know the Ford Probe is made in the US, in fact it's made in Michigan, at a Mazda plant.  My question: are most of the parts from American or Japanese sources?  I have been told that most of the US assembly plants for Japanese automakers import almost all of the parts used in the vehicles. Any information anyone has on this will be appreciated! Tim Newman
re: extended Ka bands. I recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm nuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out: - A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know    what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I   explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,   "Ka stands for K automatic"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that   plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high   tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much. - My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,   even the real sneaky ones. - When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here   or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used   a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of. So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet. eliot

In this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians would have burned no matter what, ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and therefore rocket to heaven.  A few comments from the remaining Davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this theory (One cult member said that she wished that she had been there, and that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them.  She actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them). While I think that Vernon started the fire (his followers anyway),  it is incidental to their reaction. --  <><><><><><><><><><> Personal opinions?

>Colossians 2:11-12 "In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of >the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been >buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the >power of God, who raised him from the dead." > >In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a >personal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Do >infants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it. I don't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not. Certainly they *can*, as the example of John in utero proves. I find the translation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ, which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ's cricumcision which we, in union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh. Also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism, which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with Christ by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their baptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless. Like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add to their baptism faith and obedience. Baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the basis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of God. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy. > >Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For >Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith >comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word >of Christ." > >So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the >gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids >are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to >respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot >be raised in baptism to a new life. Do you teach a child to pray the Lord's prayer? Do you expect them to not steal? They *can* have faith appropriate to their condition. And in the new covenant, we shall no longer say: know the lord, for they shall all know him from the least unto the greatest Heb 8:11. >If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty >for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam. But also according to Ezekiel 18, God will not hold innocent anyone on the basis of anyone elses innocense. Thus Jesus could not be our federal head any more than adam, *IF* that's what ezekiel is talking about. Shall you make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well?   > >Ezekiel 18:31-32 "Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted, >and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel? >For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. >Repent and live!" > >The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids >cannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we >will then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live. Ezekiel 36:25-26 indicates that this new heart will be given by God, in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism. It is the action of God puting them into his new order, and not a question of"personal" faith as such. >Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and >death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all >sinned--" > >Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to >each man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through all >of Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than >others, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all >saying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such. > But the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal death, but the dead state (originbal sin). We are in a covenant of death, because adam, our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death. >Psalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother >conceived me." > >This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves >before God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God's >own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and >murdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can't >remember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before God >by confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is >a hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literal >interpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25). >For another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26. While this psalm is figurative in it's language, it is not hyperbolic, and the one does not necessarily imply the other. There is not other hyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is  what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). The whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burnt offering, etc) David's sin with bathsheba included this element, as he did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have.  But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was  passed generationally. That's why the organ of generation had to be cut. That's why brith was unclean. Uncleanness was death, and all babies were born dead, and needed to be washed to newness of life, which we have in baptism today. paul duggan

Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!  The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I can't stand it! Aside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good  on most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense.  Boston players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net except for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he's also getting plenty of help. Boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the  series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the  game.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single game (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite bleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they have an excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the  2nd and 3rd periods. (The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year.    I'll never cheer for the Sabres... You can't convert me... ^:) MTM3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike Mosscrop  --  Die hard Bruins fan Dept. of Chemistry UMass-Lowell

I'm not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one. But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm to which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom. As far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right. It's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At last Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist. Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to think for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out of this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh. Spoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through that amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for granted.  God, look at Chicago... And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna last forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.   Mom.

 I have been studying the Bible now for about a year.  I love it, but I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or traditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups. I have heard various people (outside this news group) describe *idols* such as power, money, material  possessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I  suppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...   I have been reading the postings in this news group (which I  just found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I'm not trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my views on anyone else (I haven't been at this long enough to have any views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good, I must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that I could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that every time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in Christ's side because He took the punishment for my sins, when He died on the cross). In my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is,  but that's about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary  could be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary? It sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself I'm sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about Tongues (I'm reading "Charismatic Chaos").  I guess I'll study Tongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can  give me will be appreciated.     ------------------------------------------- [I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than you (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a different tradition than yours. This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics generally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The issue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine. Since this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one would understand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestants don't accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the Church, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible. I interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am not prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in learning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of course a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally consider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and various subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it's a matter of how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those who don't.  There are also a number of major historical traditions, but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I'd  identify the major Protestant traditions as:   Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between   Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,   Church of Christ But there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to be so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general "evangelical" perspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still quite marked. I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book on church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really needs to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history will normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and give a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I'm away from my library at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend. --clh]

This is ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like a nut, if what is reported here is what the doctor actually said.  If your wife's pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic, she'll need insulin replacement.  That doesn't mean she's "dependent" on insulin, anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make enough, she'll have to get it elsewhere.  Oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism, and it's really the only effective therapy available anyway.  Plus, it's cheap.  Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone, but that's a _feature_, not a _bug_, and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism, because her problem that her gland isn't producing enough.  There isn't a clinical phenomenon of "thyroid insufficiency" caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids, so there should be no worry about inappropriately "suppressing" the thyroid gland. >The last couple of  >monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given >some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the  >'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language, >but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the  >brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)

In some earlier discussions on this thread I may have given the impression that even though children didn't  require baptism it wouldn't hurt if they were. To the contrary, when you baptize children before they are capable of comprehending it you deny them  their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to serve God. Have any of you considered that children are not accountable for sin because they are not capable of  repentance? Peter said to a group of "men and brethren," "Repent and be baptized every one of you" (Acts 2:38). Notice that he specified that if they *repent* then  they may be *baptized*. In following Peter's instructions people must first demonstrate repentance (a forsaking of their sins and  a desire to obey God's commands) *before* they are  eligible to be baptized. Since young children are not capable of repenting, they are not eligible for baptism. And since God is both just and merciful "sin is not  imputed when there is no law" (Romans 5:13), young  children are not accountable for what they can't  comprehend. A IDLER

Forwarded from the Mars Observer Project                        MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT                              April 30, 1993                               11:30 AM PDT DSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29) at approximately 6:00 AM.  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days. As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today. Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency Mode entry.  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3.  Playback of DTRs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completed yesterday, was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight Sequence C9 execution.  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart C9 to complete data playback.  Present planning is to perform playbacks between  as soon as Wednesday, or as late as Friday of next week (5/5- 5/7), dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity.  DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second.  Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will be maintained at the 4K S & E rate.      ___    _____     ___     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.
ESPN is pathetic, I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage and I agree with all of you.  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up over nothing.  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck.  I mean have you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey? It sucks, I mean really sucks!!!  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass.  I was really pissed of about last night, coverage.  I go to school in Ohio I *know* the Indians suck, so why show them?  If I were Bill Clement I would shoot myself. Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going to happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring Devils game. Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract        obligations*, screw you ESPN. Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit! GO HAWKS!!! JB

	Tony,  I believe, first of all, that Max's car is an Austrailian built car.  I don't think its a chopped up U.S. unit.  It may be called a Kangaroo or Roo or something similar-not sure.  But, I do recall reading that Austrailian cars used Ford V-8 engines.  The Ford V-8 Interceptor is, I think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor.  Whatever the case that small car with a screaming big block Ford 428 would probably smoke the tires for miles/kilometers.  I hope someone out there can elaborate on the subject.

Judging from replies I received about my "Semantics on t.p.g" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g assume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  It would also follow that said person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or business. >Would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed?  How about someone at >home?  Note that both are legal, and a lot of "common" people qualify >for one or the other. > >-andy >-- Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home. Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I am not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street. Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense. I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now is that Freeman and I are "running around in circles" trying to prove each other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some- times.

The idea of 'sorting it out in court later' is fine, but one has to GET TO COURT IN ONE PIECE to do that.  Korash had good reason to think that he was not going to get that chance.  (see below). <aren't in it to beat up and kill people, in spite of the actions of a <few bad apples.  If you quit resisting, they quit hitting.  Perhaps the <BATF did over react to the threat posed by Koresh.  Perhaps they did use <too much force.  OK, fine.  I'm willing to concede to that point if <sufficient proof is produced (and I admit that there is some evidence to <indicate this).  However, resisting the BATF is the worst thing Koresh <could have done.  If they hadn't resisted, there is a good chance that <no one would have been hurt.  Remeber, they were using stun grenades, <not anti-personnel grenades.  If the BDs were not in violation of any Rember, Korash didn't get to sort this all out, serenely typing at his keyboard.  He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off, he saw he was being ATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh, its ok, its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door at that point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fear of his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Have you ever been shot at?  How clear and logically could you think, under that pressure, when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluate what is going on?  And, it would not be the first time that 'law enforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally.  For all we know, he was informed by someone saying something like "Hey, guy, the BATF is coming like gangbusters, and they mean to WASTE you..." According to the latest news, the released warrant (so we are told) said the reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around $200,000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period). Now, even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a drug siezure, for 90 people, that isn't really all that much (you priced decent guns lately?).  Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is an avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal, nor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what is the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad for some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons? This administration has only one thing in mind.  CONTROL.  PEOPLE CONTROL. Whether it is gun control, Clinton Cripple Chip, National smart ID cards, it all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL.  Can you say 1984, only 10 years late? I knew you could...  :-) <laws, they would have been released as they had been before.  If this <had happened and it turned out that the BATF had used too much force, <then the BDs would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges <of civil rights violations (Sounds a lot like LA, huh?  Don't take that <wrong, I'm not commenting one way or the other about the Rodney King <case).  But that's not what they wanted.  They got tipped off that the <BATF was on the way in, and rather than adopting a non-violent, <non-threatening posture to greet the BATF, they decided to fight. And BATF knew the BDs were expecting them (via 60 minutes report).  But they decided they were so big, so bad, they would have a cakewalk at the BDs expense, for a nice media show anyway.  But it all turned to shit, and the FBI taking over to manage things, we see it all turned to shit, too.  Clinton says 'I am taking full responsibility'...  BAH. Responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong.  Bet you NOBODY pays any serious repercussions.  'Responsibility' only has meaning as media PR, or as a means to corner the average Joe Schmoe. Figure it out... Clinton, Reno, the FBI and BATF, will all be IMMUNE.

>I don't think trading Kisio was intrinsically a mistake; however, trading him >for a 3rd round pick would be; he should have been worth a lot more than a >3rd round pick for a playoff team.  In fact, I would intimate that the offers >the Sharks got this year for Kisio were way greater than just a 3rd round pick. Hindsight's 20-20. Nobody expected Kisio to have his 2nd best career year. >>Besides, without Kisio, the Sharks would have tanked even earlier in >>the season, and Gund might have gotten a little more serious >>about getting Joe Murphy, a guy who definitely would be around >>3 - 5 years from now when the Sharks do make the playoffs. > >What else could be done?  The Gunds offered $2 million for Murphy, but the >Oilers wanted prospect(s), which the Sharks declined to give, which I think is >correct. I didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't enough.  Gund's offer was the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the playoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn't help Sather with his immediate objectives, doesn't help with long term objectives (only a prospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that). However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund panicks sooner in November. And here's another what-if twist: Chicago would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan all look like geniuses. A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston (and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you shiver doesn't it. :-) Bottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for Kisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one. >>If the Kisio-fiasco was the cause of Ferierra's down fall, I hope >>it wasn't because he tried to trade Kisio, but because he screwed it >>up.

Eve'. I am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don't have much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Does anyone have any experience with the following brands? 	Riken 	Falken	 	BFG	 	General	 There are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. Like I said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since I hardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that "noone will give you warranty on such tires", according to a tire dealer? Finally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again), or is that strictly a speed factor?

Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays  that one should have over a given period of time because of all the  environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation  is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical  formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus  in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors  in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may  be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care  to comment?). Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones,  I don't think that there are many drugs that can help "dissolve" the  kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium  have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the  aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could  speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that  a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery  is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second  opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break  up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are  notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.   My condolences to your friend.  Marty B.
>Then post what the press has said, not what you wished they said. >The Medical Examiner has refuted the FBI "facts" and if you don't >believe someone who has a LOT more reason to be impartial then  >what do you have to say for yourself. In the interest of accuracy (seems a liitle late to start that, I know) the medical examiner has *not* contradicted the FBI. The FBI said they found some folks who had been shot in the head, and the medical examiner said "we have not seen evidence of this". At the time the medical examiner said that, they were dealing with charred bodies in the compound - this sounds like typical medical examiner not releasing details until a thorough investigation.  The medical examiner saying he hasn't seen something is *not* the same thing as saying that it isn't there. While it might end up being true that the FBI had spoken falsely, it isn't clear yet that they have.
> I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like. For example, is >there a constant sensation of falling?  Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first, but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that of sky diving. >And what is the motion sickness >that some astronauts occasionally experience?  It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.  Some people are  more prone to it than others, like some people are more prone to get sick  on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental part is usually induced by  a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down, ie: the Shuttle is  normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth, so the Earth  (or ground) is "above" the head of the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts  experience some form of motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in  space to try to see how to keep the number of occurances down.      ___    _____     ___     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

This syringe was intended to be used with a special trocar for injecting ferric chloride into aneurysms, and thus to heal them by coagulation. 1853.  Alexander Wood (1817-84)  of Edinburgh invents the hypodermic needle and adapts Pravaz's syringe for use with it."

Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it. If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication. >I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to  >succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld >(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering, >chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created >to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight. As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering the microworld isn't the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have to orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use  technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of  using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in  dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in  hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is  stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So  now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far. We also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now. >So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective >methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies >which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation. This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies. >Such a detailed >literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates >and clearly important to existing space programs. >In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into >various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies. >This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the >basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet, >and any other source! Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net, I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search  first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data base itself could be useful for future engineers. That's my response Ken, what do you think? Tim

I have the same problem with my '90 probe.  The water is definitely not comming up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare.  I have to remove the rubber stopper to drain the water.  Seems like a common problem with probe.

This must vary from state to state, because our old company Kemper wanted to drop me (keeping my wife) or tripple our premium because i had 1 ticket. Only 2 points for 10 mph over speed limit.  Well i called Geico, and they insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying Kemper. Generally i hate the whole insurance game. I realize that it is necessary but the way that a person can get dicked around doesn't make any sense.

>  >Hello, a friend is under going kemotherapy(sp?) for breast cancer. I'm >trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated. >Thanks. You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy. The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time. Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle. The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs. The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized  aagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide. There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis. Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis. At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing. If what you are seeking is "practical" advice, I apologize for rambling on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to  experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications  can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important. Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person  themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this too, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data. I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society. They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition, if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend "Reach for Recovery". It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast  because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions. If you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good access to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people. I wish the best to you and your friend.
The last time we discussed homosexuality, I asked whether anyone could identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible prohibited, but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent harm to anyone. Put another way, the question is whether homosexual intercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe is immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight being offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my question in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting response based on Roman Catholic theology). However, I think now that I can at least answer my first question. Link Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping with one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society, that is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage (and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception. The trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular relationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to how they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but all the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't a man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is dead and that he has "married" her? How does this case differ from the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife. Are these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps that God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable of understanding why. P.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe, as some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions. You don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't know me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic remarks. --  Stan Armstrong.

Someone might think  [...etc...] >Since when did conservative, protestant, old-time religion believers get >an exclusive francise to christianity?

I, fo one, am not ready to concede to _any_ group- be they >"liberal" or "conservative", catholic, protestant, or orthodox, charismatic >or not- the right to claim that they have _the truth_, and everyone else >is not "christian." I am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Paul's illustration about one body / many parts far too narrowly. It is easy to say that the one body represents a particular sect of Christianity (generally our own), and the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. There is a place for that. But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide variety of doctine - Catholic, Protestant, liberal, conservative, Orthodox, etc. - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the context of the 'body of Christ.' And I am equally sure that one day, after we shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darkly but see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the things we held as truth. We ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we are called, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone else is called. One of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - can't recall the name) put it quite succiently: 	In essentials, unity. 	In nonessentials, liberty. 	In all things, charity. While I agree with Lewis (Mere Christianity) that calling oneself a Christian implies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean anything at all, I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit too broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those bounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together.  Me? I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an inerrantist, though I'll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately pre-mill, and evangelical. But, I'm not ready to damn those who use icons, say mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really don't believe that she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism for salvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth - why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth? But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually evolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word, and fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.                       --T.S.

But colonic flushes are not the  way to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of  bacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of  antibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in  your gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real  problem in some of the outfits that do this "treatment" since the equipment  is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient "treatments". Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've  picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his  instruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is  also used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and  disposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than  the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much  higher fees do not drive away patients. I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to  this colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, you  subject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV. Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment? Could they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a  pathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not  cleaned properly between patients?

I agree with Jeff's reply.  I've never changed the brake fluid except when having a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of freeway driving).  However, I will start to do this as preventative maintenance on my new car.  Also, there are brake system flushing agents that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the system, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless you are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent.  Just for your info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for flushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don't know if it was more without the brake job. This is in the S.F Bay Area.

Though David Sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that talk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the Second Amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out  of relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active  threads discussing EXACTLY this topic which at least explore the fallacies  of his erroneous claim, and at most explode them. to keep and bear arms;" not a "right of the people to form a militia," a "right of a militia to keep and bear arms," or a "right of well-regulated people to keep and bear arms."

Astronomy & Space magazine's UK telephone newsline carries the times to see the Russian Space Station Mir which will be visible every EVENING (some time between 9 o'clock and midnight) from April 27 to May 7. It's about as bright as Jupiter at its best. There are two cosmonuats on board. For the time to watch, tel. 0891-88-19-50 (48p/min peak 36p/min all other times, but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a few pence). E-mail reports of sightings would be appreciated: give lat/long and UT (a few seconds accuracy if possible) when it passes ABOVE or BELOW any bright star (say brighter than mag. 3), planet or Moon. With Moon in evening sky also, note that from somewhere in U.K. Mir will pass in front of the Moon each night! Please alert local clubs to the telephone newsline, and general public as Mir can cause quite a stir! -Tony Ryan, "Astronomy & Space", new International magazine, available from:               Astronomy Ireland, P.O.Box 2888, Dublin 1, Ireland. 6 issues (one year sub.): UK 10.00 pounds, US$20 surface (add US$8 airmail).

I will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of Jesus "paying" for our sins in the sense that many Christians accept as literal. The point is that God understands the suffering we go through, not just intellectually like when we watch the Somalians on TV, but _really_ understands, He can "feel"  our pain. This fact is manifested by Jesus' life. We can argue that someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus, we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion, we can think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to worse despair, but the main point is that Jesus is in the trenches with us, He is in everyone, whatever I do to the least of humanity I do to Him, and whatever I do for the least of humanity I do for Him. Now, to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my capabilities, but that wasn't my goal. > I'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through,  Thankfully our moderator is surprising. > but I seriously want a reasonable explanation for this.

If you want the full document, ask me by mail --Rex]     "Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner consciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ briefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the attributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would mean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death, free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm of the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which was not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the divine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die, not in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human nature.      This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the human nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the person. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited power, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There is, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential perfection of the Godhead.      We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the possession of the double natures.  Christ's human nature is impersonal, in that it attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the God-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the Man. Nature is defined: "the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental character, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and unchangeable."      Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such the Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind.  Personality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the power of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature of Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.  LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally important to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as such, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say that Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is theanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the human and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will are simply human or simply divine." [The quotation given above is not identified, and it's not entirely clear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity, let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic Christological heresies -- monothelitism.  That's the position that Christ's two natures were not complete, in that there was only one will.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the human will that was regarded as missing. Normally people who talk about Christ's human nature as being "impersonal" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they are using "person" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of personality.  In this use, the doctrine is called "anhypostasia". Personally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of denying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never been formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential theologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the quotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went, into the realm of the overtly heretical. --clh]

In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks,  I came across something that was completely new to me,  and I thought I'd offer it for comment. To keep this as brief as possible, let me state my  observation as a declarative statement, and then whoever  wants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think  I've observed is that the phrase "the Ten Commandments",  as used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but  rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex.  20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase "the Ten  Commandments" should more accurately be translated "the  Ten Discourses", of which the passage we call the "Ten  Commandments" is really only the first. I'm not completely convinced that the above is true, but  for purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I  was sure. Arguments supporting the above idea: 1)  There aren't really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.   In order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of  them out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not  support such a division because they are all about not  worshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to  have no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship  the idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can't violate  verses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that  the whole passage is one command, and leaving us with  only Nine "Commandments".  I could go on at length about  this, but for now I'll just stop with this summary. 2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning of the traditional "Ten Commandments") and Ex 31:18  (where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the  Ten Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break  these ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33;  25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38;  31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these  passages begins with some variation of the phrase, "And  the LORD spoke to Moses, saying..."  The exception is  Ex. 21:1, which begins "Now these are the ordinances  which you are to set before them..." 3)  The word translated "commandments" in the phrase  "the Ten Commandments" isn't really the word for  "commandment", its the word for a speech, or an  utterance.  It's a word often used for longer discourses  rather than individual statements; for instance, when  combined with the word 'yom' (day), this word is  translated "Chronicles" in such phrases as "now the rest  of the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the  Chronicles of x?..."  The word for "commandment" is  freely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps  it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X's,  he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and  chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer  than just a single command. 4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the  stone tablets "with the law and the commandments" (Ex  24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He  has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the  Ten Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not  immediately clear why God would wait several days and  nine more discourses before giving these tablets to  Moses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses  written on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that  God would not give Moses the tablets until He had  finished delivering all Ten Discourses. 5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both  tablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If  these Ten "Commandments" were only the first 17 verses  of Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE  letters!  Not that He couldn't have, of course, but it  does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to  two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal- sized letters. 6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out  the "commandments written on stone" as being the  "ministry of death", "that which is fading away," and  "the ministry of condemnation."  With the possible  exception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is  difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in  Ex. 20:1-17 as being temporary, "fading away"-type  commandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone  tablets should happen to have included all of the  commandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31. Arguments against this idea: The main argument against this idea, aside from the fact  that it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that  in Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in  Ex. 20:1-17, "These words the LORD spoke...and He added  no more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and  gave them to me."  This appears to identify the words  just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone  tablets. That was my first impression, anyway.  However, after  some thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how  you understand the phrase "These words."  If Moses meant  "These words *which I have just related to you* were  spoken by God" etc., then that would mean that only the  traditional "Ten Commandments" were on the stone  tablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical  comment--"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were  spoken by God" etc.--then that's quite different. I did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of  being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the  people asking Moses to represent them before God,  whereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of  Moses between the first and second discourses, several  days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This  reinforces the idea that Moses' remarks in Dt 5:22ff  were intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a  strictly chronological account of when God wrote what,  and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the  tablets. likely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only  the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses  of God.  I don't know if anybody has ever espoused this  idea before; it's brand-new to me.  So, while I lean  towards accepting it, I would be very interested in  hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to  offer. - Mark

The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries. I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did. ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission] "There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries" By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services      On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings  is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.      It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called  Families USA.       The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe  that doctors make too much money.      The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for  physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be  OK.      How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.      Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment  and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign  and are still simmering.      You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that  earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority  of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who  do are stealing it from them.      Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.   Karl Marx lives.      It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such  as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to  become a physician?      If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should  have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they  should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much  a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a  doctor?      Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "How  much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent  grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order  to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking  courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and  maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years  of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth  years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and  (d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e)  put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training,  depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in  debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60  hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or  more until they retire or fall over?"      As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably  more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and  Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have  called together to remake America's health care.      Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far  more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing,  social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is  to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.      But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates,  many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the  major cause of high medical costs.      Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.   Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for  our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in  a McDonald's?      And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become  a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch  cabbages.      Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or  Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But  instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain,  they might have been more honest if they had said:      "Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest  problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes,  you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you  guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack;  getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the  microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into  the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot  victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease  while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.      "You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single  biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is  amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.      "In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at  your blubbery bods all day.      "So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and  start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do."      But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid,  there is another solution: Don't use them.      That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those  spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands  upon your head and declare you fit.      Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest  pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit  there, and pop in a couple of valves.      You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that  overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house  than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and  malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?      Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.   And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on  how to give it its shots.      By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much  pollsters should earn?

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in a prison cell of some sort. She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about  what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.   For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since  Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette. our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims.

Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33. Thanx

People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to consider reasonable alternatives. However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's no longer necessary to be an "independent thinker" to depart from the government's party line.  It looks like our "independent press" may  actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is a good sign.  I hope it continues. > Here's a clue.  Independent thinkers are able to come to either conclusion  > depending on the circumstances.  Non-critical thinkers are the ones who would  > always come to the same type of conclusion regardless of the circumstances. Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one set of facts are being presented, "coming to a conclusion" is not the  hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability to challenge those "facts" critically.  The scientific method consists of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing between two hypotheses that other people have proposed. -- 
	Ok, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here's the latest; Toyota 4runner: 	 Small. Small Small Small. The interior of this vehical is impossible 	for a large person. Too bad; it would have been the winner otherwise. Nissan Pathfinder: 	 	Very low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has 	a cheap-looking interior. Isuzu Trooper: 	Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable, 	handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it's huge, 	and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is  	weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10" 	shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to  	park in in San Francisco. No Thanks. Chevy Blazer: 	Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still  	too small. Ford Explorer: 	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader. 	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the 	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would 	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and 	shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like, 	but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get 	into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10" shorter 	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual  	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying.  	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it? 	Anyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories?  	Also, any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo, both being essentially 	the same vehical?

I agree with Gaia. Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car so far, a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind. In my opinion, getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough. In my case, that's be cause; anything that needed repairing in the interior (sunroof, windows, doors,  etc.) I could do myself. I just didn't want to mess with the engine and such. Plus I think the extra 3 years of 24-hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so meting. I opted for the 5 year plan for $375. Thomas
Can the Sabres win two more games against the Bruins? I think game three in Buffalo will be the most important of the series.  If the Sabres lose that game, the party will be over.  It will  be hello next year. The key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr can keep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by  the Bruins.  He has shown demonstrated excellent speed. Finally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season. Sabres/Bills Fan          
Good point - there haven't even been any recent posts about Ulf!  Secretly, I'm convinced that he's responsible for the Bs being down 3-0 to Buffalo, somehow.

I'd been spending a small fortune on various creams, lotions, and other dry skin treatments. He said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline. Soak in a lukewarm tub of water for 10 minutes (ONLY 10 minutes!) then massage in the vaseline, to trap the moisture in. That will help. I haven't tried it yet, but you can bet I will. The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the vaseline properly. If it's not done right, you remain greasy and stick to your clothes. Try it. It's got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of 'natural' lotion. Jane

I've mentioned this study a couple of times now: Ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal vaginitis, Annals of Internal Medicine, 3/1/92 116(5):353-7.  Do you have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than capsules of lactobacillus (even though it had positive results)? The study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of yogurt.  There was a marked decrease in infections while women were ingesting the yogurt.  Problems with the study included very small numbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only 21 patients were analyzed).  Still, the difference in rates of infection between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly believable. --  David Rind
Michael> The kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is Michael> that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket Michael> equation of homosexual behavior and rape.  Since Christians Michael> citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have Michael> at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge Michael> that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us. and Michael>  It is just Michael> as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a Michael> secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate Michael> homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the Michael> rape of God's messengers. Let's review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly.  It states clearly that the visitors were angels.  But "all the men from every part of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the house.  They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to  you tonight?  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex  with them.' "  For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men of Sodom and by Lot as *men*.  Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21 that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--before the angels visited the city.  It is clear that the grievous sin of Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex.  It appears that the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had group orgies in the public square--which simply indicates  the extremity of their depravity.  It does not show that lesser  degrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have us believe. Ultimately our understanding of God's will for sexuality comes from the creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  He created us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship between one male and one female, "Therefore a man will leave his father and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become one flesh."  This marriage relationship is the only sexual relationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture of the relationship between himself and his church.  But we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between  two men, or between two women. Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from or expresses God's will in instituting and blessing marriage.  Thus the Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest, homosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and the coveting of our neighbor's wife; other commandments forbade rape. The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and perverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage relationship.  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural', Romans 1:26,27--not because this was simply Paul's opinion, but because it was contrary to God's purpose in creating us male and female.    Michael> Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here Michael> and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they Michael> ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously Michael> have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL Michael> ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest Michael> charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can Michael> manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they Michael> suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss Michael> our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what Michael> it is.

Jason - I've heard the people who are talking about this dismissed as conspiracy nuts, but nobody seems to be talking about a conspiracy, at least at the beginning.  There were a lot of bad decisions that went into this tragedy, and some people may now be taking some serious evasive action to avoid being held responsible for the unexpected results of those bad decisions.  Actually, the only ones I see that are tied into a conspiracy theory are the ones raving about deranged cultists with stockpiles of weapons and suicide pacts. >Admittedly mistakes were made but why attribute them to malice rather >than stupidity? I think there are a lot of us that have been following this pretty closely from the beginning, and we woud probably agree that this tragedy was more the result of stupidity than malice.

Hello all,           There is a small problem a friend of mine is experiencing and I  would appreciate any help at all with it. My friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring  antidepressants for a cure. The main problem is the side effects of these.  So far she has been prescribed Prozac, Aurorix, and tryptanol all with  different but unbearable side effects. The Prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina, it was impossible to  sit still for more than a minute or so. The Aurorix whilst having a calming effect, all feelings were lost and the  body co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. Her brain was clouded  over. The tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco-  ordination occurred. She did not know what she was doing as her brain was  "closed down". Has anyone had similar problems and/or have any suggestions as to the next  step? Thankyou in advance. Gordon Taylor
Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is  relevant for med students too. Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically. Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy,  histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass  memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most  med students are. Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I  have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have never applied them to large amounts of "data". Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or cheap software?    Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an older student who returned to school this year, organization (another one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success. Please no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the material conceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong  points.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization.   Thanks for your help.

It offers as good an analysis of the meaning of the Second Amendment, especially regarding the militia clause, as I have seen.  I have not seen any rebuttles with similar bone fides... Enjoy.  (Flames to /dev/null) --------- Begin Enclosed Article ----------- 			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT 			      by J. Neil Schulman If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan, right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ? That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise. Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field. He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award. That sounds like an expert to me. After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter: "I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text. "The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.' "The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.' "I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary." My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded: "I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance." After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity): [Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia. "In reply to your numbered questions: [Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?" [Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people." [Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?" [Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia." [Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?" [Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence." [Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?" [Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia." [Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?" [Copperud:] "(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military." [Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated." [Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: "Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.' [Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence, "A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.' "My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be, "(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and "(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?" [Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure. "(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation." Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion." So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right. As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power. And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution. And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing. it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ? Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

>>>>people in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up That has sort of happened for real.

With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks (much to my delight) I noticed their 8 (?) game playoff losing streak (4 to the Pens last year, and now 4 to the Blues) and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive losses is, if there even is one... I'm pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a 9 game losing  streak, since they've had to have lost a series since their last championship (whenever that was) Basically, I need something else to rag on my Hawks-fan friend with :) Mike, the insomniaced --- ***Yes-Rush-Marillion-Emerson, Lake and Palmer-Genesis-Dream Theater*** * Mike Weintraub, aka Jvi on IRC   ________.sig Quote du Jour________ * * The American University         | is always right, but sometimes   |* * Washington, DC                  |_each one is"__Neil Peart, Rush___|* ***Go Philadelphia Phillies and Vancouver Canucks (3 down, 13 to go)***

First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat, not humans. Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be turned into heat. 2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous. It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than play around with 2,4-DNP. But if you insist, I suggest you look up the literature in your own university library.  You can obtain 2,4-DNP by taking a first year organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's a commonly-used reagent).

The key for Sabres's win over Boston is whole team's strong commitment >as an underdog and all their talent players including Mogilny and Fuhr. > I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that! While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well, I still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr, the series would now be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres. In both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres the chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2.  Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to indicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been for Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was) through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open up the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game).  There is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the victory.  In my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as LaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get extraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev (compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense , IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton playing a regular shift afterall ;-) The difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog.

>If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the Bible >ever say so.  It never comes right and says "Only people that know >right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised." This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies. It assumes that if the Bible doesn't say specifically that you don't need to do something, then that must mean that you do need to do it. I know there's a specific term for this form of logic, but it escapes me right now. However, if it were sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; If the Bible doesn't specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be OK, which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question I've often pondered. If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyone else in this group does too?), why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostles speak out against it? Owning slaves was common practice back then. Paul speaks about everything else that is immoral. He apparently thought it was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. Why doesn't anyone mention slavery? If God's morals are eternal and don't change like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral then as it is today.

Cute anecdote, but hardly indicative of the population.  From the responses I've received to that post (all from men, by the way) I get the impression that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the need or desire strikes, then that person is very hung up on sex. With tv programs about "boobs" (Seinfeld) and "masturbation (again Seinfeld) and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage pregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the States, I would not assume that we American's are frightened of sex.  Rather we are a bit stupid about it.  Healthy sexuality does not require flamboyance or promiscuity.  It requires responsibility. Deantha

I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under  >>"right to bear arms." >   > If the waco wackos truly had grenade launchers and rocket launchers, why > weren't they used against the armored vehicles that attacked their house? > All the media stated was that small arms (ie, ineffective) fire was used > against them. I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that David Koresh had "explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40 feet into the air."  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out. Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this so-called "explosion" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited. We figure that this is what it was because of how the "explosion" looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT, dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day. Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide? Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS. What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets, or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to make sure that others "find" what they want for them to "find" if you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades. Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop  pass at his own blue line, and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat  Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald  was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy  to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed  on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest  periods I've seen Sweden play this year.  Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many  times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial  save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal  from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way  to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a  nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4  just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of  the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole.   Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled  through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,  Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close  range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,  and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.

Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just  deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play  goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the  far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.  Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of  the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.  Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya  entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,  then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to  deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.  The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side  and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.    Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri  Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and  in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,  and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros  after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.  Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,  7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player  (among those Kariya with 1+6).

     I also experience this kinda problem in my 89 BMW 318. During cold start ups, the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out, for about 5km, the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress the clutch, the whole chassis moves along. But after preheating, it becomes smooth again. I think that your suggestion of being some humudity is right but there should be some remedy. I also found out that my clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more!

Hi, I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi Galant GS transmission.  The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission. Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless  I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a "popping" or "hitting" sound. The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say  this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT? And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK while attempting to put it in reverse:    1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.    2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is       fully depressed.    3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.    4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was       stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if       it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)    5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having        someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),       while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.    6- The shifter acted normally after that. When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the  clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k. I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last week.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because  Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car.   In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage, and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily solving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck.  I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting  from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get  the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems,  and with how to handle Mitsubishi.   All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to bore you with the long post. Thanks, Rabih.

  There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss.  The  few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher ently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it).   Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromium will increase muscle mass and decrease fat.  Of course, chromium is also used t o cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(just as well as anabolic steroids). Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-)  On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...                                     -Paul      ----------------------------------------------------------     |  Paul Sovcik, Pharm.D.

Here is a press release from the U.S. Department of Energy.  Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel Vehicles    WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a "driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies."    President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.    President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.    "I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make this happen," O'Leary said.  "As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country."    The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation.    "The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country," O'Leary said.  "Increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believe that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy economy are complimentary goals."    O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical.    Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available.  -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

	My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome. 	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it.  	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions). I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. .  I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia. I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology. Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much improvement in her condition over the past several months.  -Jackie-  
Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director                                  GALILEO                      MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT                                POST-LAUNCH                            April 23 - 29, 1993 SPACECRAFT 1.  On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43 (Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results  indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed. 2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received properly. 3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS (Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD). 4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly. 5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43. 6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28. The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately 20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.      After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink, a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test mini-sequence. 7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase. 8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees, back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4 degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration. 9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN (3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team. 10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:        a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 203 hours GDS (Ground Data Systems): 1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN (Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna). 2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant schedule changes or significant problems were reported. TRAJECTORY      As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows: 	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU) 	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU) 	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour 	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km 	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds SPECIAL TOPIC 1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the sequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process. In the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial RRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the stator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the RRA slew test.      ___    _____     ___     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support the doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its supporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants will go to hell. It's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically based, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let's now take a more complete look at scripture. Colossians 2:11-12 "In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead." In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a personal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Do infants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it. Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ." So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life. Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam. Ezekiel 18:31-32 "Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted, and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!" The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids cannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we will then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live. Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is not Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it. Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--" Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to each man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through all of Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such. Romans 5:19 "For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous." Through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In the same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous. We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each man only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam. Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of view to see if it doesn't all fit together. Psalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me." This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God's own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can't remember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before God by confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literal interpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25). For another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26. Now then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is necessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with other children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc. Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling is always that they don't know any better.  Let's look to see if the Bible agrees with my gut feelings. Isaiah 7:14-15 "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right." Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy about Jesus.  If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new leader.  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human babies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over wrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose the right instead of the wrong. Jesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant, but as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as soon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was tempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13). Thank you for your attention. Moderator - this should finish up the subject for a while.  Perhaps you would like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic comes up.  Feel free to rearrange the contents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final FAQ. Sincerely, Aaron Cardenas [I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of your response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine. It was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in one form or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second, saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is an ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it. The original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptists still hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infants without believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacraments tend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants who baptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us, rather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestant theology, God's grace precedes our response, and is applicable to children.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate that God accepts even children.  --clh]

Is this a problem at all? It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision, but that he interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con- sciousness, translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above that of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting it wrong.  Not that he did it rationally, but rather that unconsciously the perceptions became clothed in material images, instead of remaining in the realm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound.  This difficulty of translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been difficult, even for the prophets of old.  That is why their prophecies are so often subject to multiple interpretations.  Likewise, the Apostles seemed to feel that the return of the Lord was to be "very soon" in the sense of perhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of "very soon" has proven to be different than they could grasp.  Prophetic vision tends to telescope time, so that things that are far off appear to be very close. Another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to happen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which was thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy. There are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and sincere and sober Christians (and others too).  It seems that great coming  events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these  "apocalyptic" times.  The various predictions (I'm talking about those that appear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com- pletely.  One has the feeling "something is about to start to get ready to  begin to commence to happen".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes, in interesting times. As for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn't help much.  There is an Old Testament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  That helps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth- quake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that give specific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they are necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the plane of earthly time and space. For what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate  could see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that  it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti- cipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in fact a spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law, knowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered a priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of making true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in  the way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I can sympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the same overwhelming experience that he apparently had,  I too might feel impelled,  and even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what  I had seen. [Do any of our church historian readers know whether there's any more prophecy now than there has been in the past?  I don't get that impression.  --clh]

The Administration has given no indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that the president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the decisions that led to the Waco Massacre, they should also suspend all activities regarding law enforcement. Given their positions, that equates to an enforced vacation. --                              REMEMBER WACO!      Who will the government decide to murder next? Maybe you?

>The most revealing comparison between Shuttle and Soyuz is cost. All >other comparisons are apples and oranges. > >--- Maximus 2.01wb I like this statement, though for my own reasons.  Cost comparisons depend a lot on whether the two options are similar, and *then* it becomes very revealing to consider what their differences are.  Can Soyuz launch the Long Exposure Facility?  Course not.  Will the Shuttle take my television  relay to LEO by year's end?  Almost certainly not, but the Russians are pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule. Comparing S and SS points up that there are TWO active space launcher-and-work-platform resources, with similarities and differences. Where they are in direct competition, we may get to see some market economics come into play. tombaker                                    --------------------------------------                                    My employer's opinions are not my own.

Yeah, diesels are cleaner than petrol powered cars. They even have catalysts  fitted to disels now! Oh and Citroen have even launched the 'First sports  diesel car in the world'. Which is probably true if you assume if its for  production purposes (Merc-Benz had a prototype which runs on diesel back in  around 1968..... it did - and read this! - 200 MPH!!!) 							....Shaz....
I am quite near sighted. I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to "weld" this back in place as well. My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often - several each hour. The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment. I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments. The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most interest to me: If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action? If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect afterwards. Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

xIf you put a locking lugnut on your tires, do you need to have your xtires rebalanced?? x xJohn Mas x Since the wheel/tire is balanced off the car i.e. the lugnuts are not normally involved, how would they do that? I would think that since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight difference in weight between a normal lugnut and a locking one would not have any noticable effect on the balance.

In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review section there was a report of a group called "Space Marketing" in Atlanta, Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising. There was an editorial about this in the Times the following Tuesday. Are others as upset about this as I am?  I feel that a global boycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a good idea.  Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries around the world?

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term -- on the order of a few years before the orbit decays.  (Higher orbits last longer.)  Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental aspects of their advertising.  Fred's argument is roughly akin to saying that it's bad to cut down trees, so we shouldn't advertise in newspapers.  Think that through, Fred. Picture this: Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure, filled with "bio-degradable" foam instead of gas.  It scoops up space debris as it orbits, thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time.  Because of the large drag coefficient, it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a year. Embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle, which does not burn up during entry.  It contains the electronics and propulsion system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science experiments proposed and built by high school students in advertiser-sponsored science fairs. Advertisers buy time on the billboard, whose surface is made up of tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package.  The avionics can reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different parts of the globe.  Clever programming allows different languages to every country. During orbital night, the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface, and small lights are revealed.  The lights spell out messages for all to see. -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office                   "HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH                     FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON                            JULY 1969, A.D.

You can get hypersonic flight data with an X-15 or a follow-on X-15 type vehicle for much less.

Without quoting at length from the preceeding post, I'd just like to say that I find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with issues like the Holocaust and Bosnia that asserting that "God is punishing them." The activity of God is always _redemptive_, which means "restoring what has been lost, broken, or distorted."  So, God does not _will_ the brokenness, lostness, distortion, genocide, poverty, etc, but is nonetheless capable, willing, and active to restore, heal, mend, and redeeem.

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not  all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium- oxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article  as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that  conventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably  always will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that  you will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of  damage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to  sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?). On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical  chemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of  calcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to  measure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the  serum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good  nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue  reserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see  how your technique compares with mine.

Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-) Where are your references?  I have been unable to find studies that state that chromium "cures diabetese".  It can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take.  "High blood pressure" - I have never heard of this claim before.  "... anabolic steroids" - I have also never heard of this claim before.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time? |>  On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place |> bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic... I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health.  It is important to exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10). Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the statistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway. Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role in "sensitizing" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin. Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose weight (4). Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This "protein sparing" effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue.  By "sensitizing" muscle to insulin, chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they "burn" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation of lean body mass has an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the fat they've lost. Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin. Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin  stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism. In summary, you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy:   A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.      - Eating fat makes you fat.   B. Increase dietary fiber      - low in calories; high in nutrients.   C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week      - burn calories.   D. Take chromium picolinate daily      - lose fat; keep muscle References: 1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

	The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2. 	The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the  numbers that counted: goals. 	Vancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to  boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of Bautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals. 	However, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the game to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second, checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early.  	The hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 2-1.  	Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush to the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do  anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were allowed to set up and make plays. 	Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably. McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck zone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead. 	A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The Jet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2. 	The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off. This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight Winnipeg defence that were never supported. 	However, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff in the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with no Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the game up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a  backhand even though he was off balance.  	By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2. 	Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games. - 30 -

> I`m NOT saying you should ban guns, OR that you should take them away > from responsible owners. But this is all gun control laws end up doing.  Politicians can never manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally, so all their laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally. Karen McNutt, a local attorney, states that there are about two MILLION licensed gun owners in Massachusetts.  In the past year, the number of licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like SIX. Yet, there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year. Does passing laws that will further restricting only those people ALREADY obeying laws pay any dividents? > All I`m saing is that guns should be treated with respect from owners, sellers > AND legislators.  So far, I've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators. > I believe guns are a problem in many countries and that crime rates > WOULD fell if they were more restricted. See, this is what I call the "argument from religion:" "I believe."  Don't believe -- it's not NECESSARY to take this on faith.  Go look at the history of countries that passed gun restrictions.  Pay particular attention to whether or not violent crime was HIGHER before the restrictions and LOWER after.  (Don't look at "violent gun crimes," that's begging the question.) You may be very surprised. > If ALL crimes done with guns stopped AND all accidents also stopped or > was reduced to a minimum THEN I would consider lifting all gun control. You have this absolutely backwards.  If crime stopped in the presence of strict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it. However, if gun control made absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT in the violent  crime rate, THAT'S when I would have it lifted.  Think about it. So far, none of the stats show any improvement... > Likevise if car-accidents fell to a minimum in europe, I (and probably > most people I know) would demand easier drivers-tests. > (ca. 20 hours and more than 2500$ today....)

Indeed, the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully enough; in particular, its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a bit higher than you would see from a black body.  Morgan&Gordon's fat "Communications Satellite Handbook" has a graph of sky temperature vs. wavelength, in fact, for communications design. However, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible. For thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the sky looks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen, "Astrophysical Quantities"). I haven't found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiation tends to be something you can't just ignore :-), but M&G says "about 4K" in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem. --

I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used      to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is      misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.     Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug     therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute      it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this     distinction becomes important. 2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible  	diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something 	people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or 	unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.   	One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual 	can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they 	are an unending source of anxiety.   	The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with  	OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to 	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part. 	Some references (one non-technical and several technical) 	that someone was kind enough to supply for me 	but was unable to post themself : |"The boy who couldn't stop washing" by judith rapaport.   *** 	(technical refs) : |	pharmacotherapy of o-c disorder |	donna m jermain and lynn crismon |	pharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-198 |	epidemiology of ocd |	seteven a rasmussen and jane eisen |	j clin psychiatry 1990;51(2, suppl.):10-13 |	the waking nightmare: an overview of ocd |	judith l rapoport |	j clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11, suppl.):25-28 |	absence of placebo response in ocd |	matig r mavissakalian, bruce jones, stephen olson |	j nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. 4 	And thanks very much to those who supplied constructive   	criticism to my first post on OCD.

I am considering the purchse of a 1987 VW Jetta GLI with 87k miles on it. I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v. I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name:  the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard sunroof.  Oops, that's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL !! So in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the two models of the Jetta GLI ? More importantly, how can I tell which version this one is ?  There are no badges that said "16v" so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version. Assuming this one (the one I looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ? (Of course I would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.) Please EMail any responses.  Thank you. Peter Volpe
There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask: 1)  If we encounter a life form during our space exploration, how do we determine if we should capture it, imprison it, and then discect it? 2)  If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will we expend resources from earth to help them? 3)  With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable, what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought back, or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere? --  Have a day,    ( )     bobo

The Apocryphal books that are in the Septuagint were part of the canon  used by the Greek-speaking churches from the inception of the church. They were not added later (or much later).  This is a common misconception. The preference of the Hebrew canon over the Greek canon is a later innovation.

Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer: I have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because it has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more "digital". Below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:   o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of     playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo     panning for each voice   o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different     attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds   o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source   o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has     access to all eight voices   o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight     MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity     sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.   o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of      modulation sources and routings.   o A 3.5" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks     allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to     1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot     for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.   o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device   o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly "page-driven"     programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface   o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening   o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1     so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on     the SQ-80. This SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while now.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily used sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer (WinCake) in its multitimbral mode. >From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves are processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80 is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter. Simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most good analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it works very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds. This SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain to use so I have avoided it. REASON FOR SALE: I am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual here in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a powerful but economical master keyboard. PRICING AND TERMS: I paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept $650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of  patches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the  original Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Craig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems phone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hello, I just want to make 2 points: 1) The FBI is not stupid. These people are chosen for their intelligence, education, loyalty to the government, etc. They are given much intensive training. So, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any conspiracy here, and say that the FBI was just stupid, I say I don't believe it. 2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the latest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of Koresh saying, "light the fire", and you can have one. Need a thermal imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of computer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing these pieces of evidence takes time. So it may be a few more days before we get to see them. Or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any FBI video is because it is: 	1) classified 	2) too gruesome for our eyes 	3) lost/got coffee spilled on it Dwayne Jacques Fontenot BTW, I get my information from live video feeds. I read the papers too, but almost everything in them contradicts what I have seen with my own eyes.
>Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes >the theory of a succession of lives. > >I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as >choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of >anything that either child had done, since they had not been born >yet. > >Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor >does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had >had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "Neither of them >has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born." > Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the man born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them, do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out. And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist, who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to  have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But  it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether  he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in  the first case and very weak in the third. I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of Christianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure. I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed  in this newsgroup in particular. I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar- nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes  important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our  understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the  significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I  have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible  to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.
/* posted for a friend -- please reply to him */ ++++++++++++++++++++++++ CAR AMPLIFIERS FOR SALE +++++++++++++++++++++++++ I have 3 high-end car amplifiers for sale: (2) Old-Style Rockford Fosgate 150's.  These are great amps, and I've never     had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on     high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased     with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and     they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell     them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already     own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked     in cars.     I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was     $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come     down on the price a little bit. (1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,     and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.     This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into     2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end     before where it did very well.     I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on     it. ============================================================================== == Chase Hacker                          "Fortune presents gifts not        == ============================================================================== ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mike Goldsman              __o          o__      o__      o__      o__     36004 Ga Tech Station    _ \<,_        _.>/ _   _.>/ _   _.>/ _   _.>/ _    Atlanta, Georgia 30332  (_)/ (_)      (_) \(_) (_) \(_) (_) \(_) (_) \(_) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ PGP Key available upon request               Just Say No to Brainwashing

YAHOOOOOOOOO! The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec City to play game 5.  BTW, final score was Habs 3-Nords 2. The score might be a bit misleading.  The Habs dominated the game from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall (bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd. Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another) and the defense was there to clear any rebounds. This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT. YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

>[deletia- Recovery programs, etc] > >I do need you to show me that there is such a thing as >a "spiritual need"; to do that it may be necessary to show >me that *spirits* (souls, whatnot) exist; God is not >important to that as far as I can tell. > I get the feeling that we are debating at cross-purposes--that we do not see the same fundamental assumptions, and this perhaps makes my answers orthogonal to your questions.  I will try again. Perhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively observable and provable things.  In that case, I cannot show you that there is such thing as a spirit or a spiritual need--these  things do not exist in the realm of the objective, but in the realm of the subjective. >OTOH, if you wish you can simply (but explicitly, please) >*assume* spirits exist, and then show me that they would >have needs, and that a.a. handles these needs in some way. >You can assume God exists too if that will help. I'll play along. > (By a.a., I assume you mean Alcoholics Anonymous, and not alt.atheism ;) I would not say that AA "handles" spiritual needs.  Rather I would say that AA (and other 12-step programs) help people come to terms with their needs--ie that AA is facilitating the recovery, and that as part of the recovery, they recognize their spiritual needs, and begin to rely on a "higher power" (12-step's term) to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse they had been accustomed to.  (Sorry, there is no objective proof here either--no way to take 2 identical alcoholics and try to have one recover by fulfilling spiritual needs, and one without and externally compare the difference--we are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of *people* here.) >But I should say, if God is a necessary component >of your "spiritual needs" then I truely do not understand at >all. It sounds to me like *spirits* have needs that should be >fulfilled by God, but can be "masked" in other ways (drugs etc). >the problem, not the solution. > Spiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to physical requirements like air, food, sleep, etc.  These are things like the need for love and acceptance, and the need for meaning in life.  If  one denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call  these "emotional needs". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs  is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual  means--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do  many meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only be satisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people who accept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since I believe in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the others are wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities: 1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--ie we all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are  deluded--they just haven't recognized it yet. 2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain chemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not have such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and  spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies. I hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritual needs cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existence of God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjective evidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I  could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that I appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals. I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and demonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertion is that such things are not objectively demonstrable.  As I have said before,  I myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the  fence by subjective evidence.  (And no, I was not raised a Christian, so it  is not a case of simply accepting what I was indoctrinated with.) == Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living,                                               | God will find his people busy Opinion, what opinions?

Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is  indeed 25K miles.

          Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:                           The Next Step                                    The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase  Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science, Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act.                               There is a small group of activists in southern California  who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns. We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon.         Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert  for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993.         All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's office. As more is known, it will be passed on.         However, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose.                             This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources  Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson's staff review a bill.         If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians.         If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space Society). --- Maximus 2.01wb

My understanding is that it's mostly there to give the detectors some directionality.  No point in doing that if you've only got one.  I'm sure the burst detectors that have flown on other deep-space missions haven't weighed that much. (Mind you, they're probably still too heavy -- the PFF people would put more Pluto-specific instruments on first, if they had any mass to spare.) --

Having recently purchased a 93 Probe with clear-coat paint, I  would like to give it a good wax job.  What is the Best type of wax to use for this type of finish?  Is paste or liquid better? I would be waxing it by hand, and buffing it by hand, I guess using cheesecloth to buff it (anything better you would suggest?). I've heard comments here before about things like Turtle Wax and Raindance not being very good, so I'm wondering what is recommended for a quality finish. Thanks in advance.

Recently, I completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had two colonics as part of it.  My motivation was primarily spiritual, to de-toxify from all the crap I've been putting in my body (not like thats enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect).  Personaly, I didn't find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic), lost about 15lbs of beer belly (which hasn't come back over the last month), and feel great.  One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from years of indulgence. Not everything that goes in comes out, and personaly I don't mind giving my body a hand once in a while. Just my experience, George Paap I am my beliefs.

A friend recorded CNN news during the gassing and incineration of the BD's.  I went through it carefully today, and found something very interesting.  A tank is pulling out of the house, and there is a fireball, maybe 24" across that lasts for about 1 second. Exactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later, the smoke starts billowing out of that area of the building. Now, I'm no govt. spokestwinkie, so it might really have been a weather balloon or something.  Perhaps someone would check it out and comment.

Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco. It is hard to  understand all this angst. What happend there is nothing less than what we wanted to happen. Why all the sour grapes ? BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no propaganda value there.  The FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed the situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the BDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan.  The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined that US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on the BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the BDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like the rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have obtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to do. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies to themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest of us - at the voting booth.  If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have become that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to vote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years, we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When the FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem to mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is raiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand. When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the public doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out of shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow. Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious fanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don't blame it on 'them', the FBI and BATF. They were just acting within the parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'. -- Jim Mason

From:  () "Freed om of Religion" has absolutely nothing to do with building a small arsenal and grooming 10-year old children to be your wife. "I'll come out as soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals." Oh, OK, David. I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this because he grew up inside the cult, and engaged in a power struggle where his supporters helped inflate his ego. That doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a shitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and twisting their impressionable little minds. This was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously. There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the stuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one, but not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. I expected this to happen. Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this was coming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus or the underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the tower to die. Fuck all of you "Big Brother" paranoid freaks. The only good thing to come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to attract some of the more rootless members of our society.

>>I think the three-headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans >>in favor of youngsters only if they offered a "significant" advantage. >Doesn't sound like a bad strategy to me. No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper, and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar. >Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal >contributions before he was fired, so it's not clear that this would have >been different.  Besides, they *were* marginal contributors. Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM. Imagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine hadn't jammed. >With or without Mullen, they weren't going to be a playoff team; what good >does it do them to hang onto a player who'd rather be elsewhere?   Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there, and that kind of thing can affect the team. >>An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis >>but not kept, because of his age.

But >>you have to find the right balance. >Right balance for what?  That's the issue.   Exactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we hadn't yet had the major injury bugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone like Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the choice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the right choice was made for that time period. --

>Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of >the Acts of the Apostles can be found? 1] An english translation of this can be found in:    "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an    introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson    (London, 1923). 2] Another work that might be useful is:    "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and    Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;    reprinted 1970). (This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it actually contains an english translation or not.) 3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:    "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in    Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966). 4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.) 5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:    "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible    Society, 1971). Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts). In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:    "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full    report (with an English translation) of the several additions and    other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...    Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the    text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the    evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272). >I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has >this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the >differences are between the long and the short forms. 6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is usually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources). 7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition (mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%. 8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if you prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail. 9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the Alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.

: Oh? Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places? : In particular, three different places where there were no APV's? The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins of the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was  crushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited,  would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV  news.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off. Propane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent  with what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm... : And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying : to get out of the compound? Remember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building. Conflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being worn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they thought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to put it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and  concussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable of moving. : And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering. Good question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the  things that the FBI said ("The BD's started the fire."  "The BD's bodies were found with gunshot wounds.") that are now being refuted by the  evidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making statements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make them sound like fact.   : I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe : a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the : the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still : prefer to believe the cultists? Yes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop string of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations on numerous occasions. And as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until they were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If the BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be dead today?   : (No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.) : >But then : >again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that : >his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office. : Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected? Yes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now if we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of apologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected accountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would happen as often as they do. : So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty : people? Are they, like, just plain evil, or what? Did they just wake up : one day, stretch and yawn, and throw a dart at a map of the United States : to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know. Acutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.   Oddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after the initial raid on the BD's.  "Coincidence?  I think not!" And as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over walls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince the world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to  a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the building.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to  cover its ass.   : And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he : on diabolical laughter? Does he look good in a cape? These things MUST be : investigated. You first. Oh, please.  If you want to argue, argue.  If  you merely want to demean those who see this differently than you, then please go somewhere else.   Keith Marchington
Not to change the subject, but how was Fr. Gobbi allowed at Notre Dame?  Notre Dame is an anti Catholic University.  Was this allowed to show that the crackpots at Notre Dame believe in freedom of speech?  I am glad that they did allow him to speak. Mike

Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its too heavy.  As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of  power for a full size Blazer.  Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the LT1 in it :).  It seems like they have a real winner with that engine.  Why spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take  an LT1?  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG (for a 5.7, that is.) [talking about Impala SS] >Will this be in the 4-door Caprice body?  I'm just curious if Chevy is >trying to resurrect their 2-door muscle cars, or to compete with the European >"super sedans." Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17" aluminum rims and Eagle GS-C tires.  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ (read:  plush police package) with 300 horsepower. I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get  their 3.4 DOHC V6 and not the LT1. >>Jon Dunn< -- ------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------

As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms and is expirienced its use and interpretation, he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist. All doctors are "qualified" to read x-rays, u/s, ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing else, and thus, is only better at reading them because of all this time spent doing this (skill in reading x-rays etc. just comes from plenty of practice). If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by this technique. - Paul. --            | Zikzak public access UNIX, Melbourne, Australia.   |   ^^^^^^^  |                                                    |   |     |  |                                                    |          ///   < O O >  |     ##########################################     |         ///

Okay, I went back and looked:  sure enough, my hunch was right. 	 		2 Peter was most likely written between 100-120 A.D. 		 		Revelation was almost certainly written between 80-96 A.D. 		 		Odds are the gospel of John was written around 90 A.D. 		 		Best dates for Luke and Acts are around 80 A.D., maybe later.

Washington, Abe Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come from the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties, but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team an advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this year, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about being hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting them up.)  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so much in his life? George

For the information of those not "lucky" enough to live in the city of Austin, TX, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks, it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  This is an ordinance unique (I think) to the city of Austin. Freon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2X cost here. Recovered freon is not required to be "purchased" from the car it is withdrawn from.  As a matter of practice, some shops here are charging  a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it  is reintroduced to the system.

TYPE:  ==== The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo- gue. The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement, dissent, or  controversy based on a difference of beliefs or doctrine; rather, the moderators will seek mainly to discourage gratuitously deroga- tory, abusive, or squalid language, and the introduction of issues which are irrelevant based on the provisions of this charter.  The moderators have been chosen through personal e-mail and through a general consensus among the proponents by discussion in news.groups. The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon: A  BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  ABOUT  AHMADIYYA  ISLAM: ===============================================         The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi- sation, was found in 1889 in Qadian, India. The founder of this movement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to  be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures of almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the  fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.         The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of  divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to  openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United Nations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns  against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement, but so far to no avail.         Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds.         The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism.         Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's internal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals.         The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal brotherhood. NEWSGROUP CREATION:  ==================         The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi- cially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news- group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more "YES/Create" votes than "NO/don't create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created.  ABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER:  ====================         Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the proposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation for the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora- do, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the newsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third party. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS: =====================         Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup may be sent to:         Any questions or problems in voting should be sent to:

It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. It is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and dusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid, heavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have been able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river and sea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon against a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap didn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera did. This is my, "never be without a camera" camera. The current water-resistant (Sport Touch I think is the name) model is nothing like as solid or well sealed. Don Mackie - his opinions

Let me know - maybe I'm missing something. >    Well, here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly. The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach about what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill me in on this info?   A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday morning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off sometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave high praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?   It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city.   Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>               is the best two-way player in the league today.'     There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.   Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs from the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about Lemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion if I'm in a different city.   Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get this off my chest.

As I recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't any medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain. Either they pass, or they have to be broken up with sound, or they have to be extracted surgically. When I was in, the X-ray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney stones and children, and the childbirth hurt less. Demerol worked, although I nearly got arrested on my way home when I barfed all over the police car parked just outside the ER. 	- Brian
After reading this story about St. Maria Goretti (posted two weeks ago), I am a bit confused.  While it is clear that her daily life is one of probity and sanctity, I am afraid I don't quite understand the final episode of her life.  I am reading it  correctly, she (and the Church apparently) felt that being raped was a sin on _her_ part, one so perfidious that she would rather die than commit it.  If this is the case I'm afraid that I  disagree rather strongly. Can anyone out there explain this one to me? Yours in Christ, David Cruz-Uribe, SFO

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die. As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Bob Schmieg

> >I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a >lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? Dave - you might like to read a book by Florence Bulle "God Wants You Rich & Other Enticing Doctrines", which discusses OOBEs in one of her chapters. In the Bible we have examples of men caught up in the Spirit (eg Ezekiel, Paul). I believe that also this experience is counterfeited by Satan - so that for example yoga and other eastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to leave the body and float off. Someone tried to sell me a book in Los Angeles airport entitled "Easy Journeys to Other Planets" which uses such techniques. The occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body departure - the book "The Challanging Counterfeit", about a former medium who gets saved, tells how the author, on his last trance, was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him while returning to his body at the end of the seance because of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally protected by the Lord. There may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and the phenomena of 'tripping'. As regards the connection between body and soul, there is an interesting verse in Ecclesiastes. In a passage talking about old age, the preacher writes "Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets. Remember Him--before the silver cord is severed." (12.5-6) My understanding of this silver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an astronaut's air-line to his spaceship. When a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches the soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken: astral projection can be dangerous! Bulle, I think, reports a case of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in his apartment, with no apparent external cause.

Ezek 22:26 God seems to be upset with the priests who have made no difference between the holy and the profane.  This brought to my mind a sermon I heard recently in which the speaker said "God's second name does not begin with a D" referring, I believe, to use of God's holy name and titles as swear words.  I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at the burning bush when God told him "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." These and other texts seem to imply that God's people must treat holy things differently from other "common" things, or "make a difference" between holy and common things. The obvious questions are  What makes something holy? and How are Christians (primarily) supposed to make this difference between holy and common things?  (e.g. God's name, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Bible, etc.) Darius

It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with torque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the highway, driving 65-70!.

If people who "speak in tongues" make claims that they are miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of the Holy Spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply making noises, it damages all Christians, since many who are not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects. The more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simply uncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the one that should be used by those who make use of this practice. I agree with the point that "Charismatic" practices like this can lead to forms of worship which are more about the worshipper showing off than genuine praise for God; one of the things Jesus warned us about.

INTRODUCTION      From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war; Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.      Science flourished during the European Renaissance. Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries.      But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity and travel to the Moon and to other planets.      The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the Sun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.      These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight and other "senses" of our automated spacecraft, color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light. And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.      Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century.       AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.      Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well as for processing data and communicating with Earth.      Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power.      Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft.      The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.      Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid-rock composition.      For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.      All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies.      Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147 pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.      In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft. Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.      Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers -- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations. Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.      NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters -- descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers from Earth and then studied martian features from above.      Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to "see" through the planet's dense cloud cover to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments -- radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their descent toward the surface.      A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet.       The Sun      A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system; all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the material left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine Earths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.      As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of fusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there is 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's surface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature. At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.      The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a "red giant," it will suddenly collapse into a "white dwarf" -- the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion years to cool off completely.      Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft, launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to change its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.      We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly never have developed on Earth.       Mercury      Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on November 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus, the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the solar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.      Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is visible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar telescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to the voyage of Mariner 10.      The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior cooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310 miles).      Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the density of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon and helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun, surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius (-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) -- is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time.      Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the Sun!       Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would make Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core or those of any of the planets.      After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two additional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 -- before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the planet's surface.       Venus      Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2 spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus, plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface, romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest.      On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839 kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much closer to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544 miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's instruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere, radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner 10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.      In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4 of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.      Five days later, the five separate components making up the second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The four small, independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour.      Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet. However, spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For example, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward) compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other planets.      Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as dense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is 482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt lead.      A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet. NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in orbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images of the surface.      Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size of Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a 100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are named for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.      Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the San Andreas Fault in California.      Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude, high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour, the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus' slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six alternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather.       Earth      As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor life, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.      Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system.      From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen radiation belts, surrounding Earth.      Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.      Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.      Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather systems.      From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey Earth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways.       The Moon      The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first human footsteps on an alien world were made by American astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo expeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.      NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds) and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.      From this material and other studies, scientists have constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy. Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3 billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain. As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode Island or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across.      This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge, overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance, called maria, meaning seas.      As far as we can tell, there has been no significant volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years. Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars, by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.      The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars. The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.       Mars      Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.      Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.      So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out. Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.      Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14, 1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water. Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide.      On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the storm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329 pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features, including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.      In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft -- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet, including, Is there life there? Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.      Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976, while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos sent back from the Chryse Planitia ("Plains of Gold") showed a bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia Planitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible dunes.      The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there.      The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.      The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees Fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2 site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.      The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out, forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys.      There is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.      Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.      The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on July 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas. Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on August 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.      Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology experiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except Earth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in September 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet.        Asteroids      The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as asteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have orbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded, best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona.      Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object, the object would be only about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the diameter of our Moon.       Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through Earth-based telescopes.      Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the meteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes Earth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.      Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks.      Since asteroids are material from the very early solar system, scientists are interested in their composition. Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances.      Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini missions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy. One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials.       Jupiter      Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of our solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter was the first port of call.      Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in March 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In December 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter, flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979.      These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize Jupiter's atmosphere.      It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.      The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a high-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a million years old.      Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.      Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey around the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a miniature solar system.      A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once past Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into Jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.       Galilean Satellites      In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first time, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet-sized satellites.      One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io. Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.      Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three Galilean moons.      Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the brightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt -- apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its center.      Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface.      Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the lowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.      Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be performed by the Galileo Orbiter.       Saturn      No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) per hour.      Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979, returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in August 1981.      The rings are composed of countless low-density particles orbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.      The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet.      Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings.      Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at Jupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near Saturn's poles.      The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps in the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by Voyager 2 in 1981.       Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and Venus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge. Unfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's dense clouds.      Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth between three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.      The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into Titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will spend years examining the Saturnian system.       Uranus      In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting Saturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet's discovery over two centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.      Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of Pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing around the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system.      Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead, the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's center, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of Djakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.      Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water vapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).      Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical "smog" believed to be a combination of acetylene, ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as "electroglow."      Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus' cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep. Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.      Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105 miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known -- Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from 520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity, including faulting and ice flows.      The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that, after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface.      Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged 11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright particles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark, boulder-sized chunks.       Neptune      Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system with an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On August 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers (3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton. During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's atmosphere was more active than Uranus'.       Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the size of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed the "Scooter," as well as high-altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per hour.      Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like Uranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.      Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is similar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores, where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.      Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings. Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings. A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies were not spotted.      Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in 1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since Proteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's glare for observers on Earth.       Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet's modest current rings.      Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at Saturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of water-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain: the so-called "cantaloupe" terrain and a receding ice cap.       Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers (1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as thick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet found in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited.       Pluto      Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside Neptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined -- tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.      Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees.       The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's and Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution are all 6.4 Earth days.       Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.       Comets      The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star.      Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets.      As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma or cloud-like "head" that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet's "tails." Gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly. As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc.      Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun. The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in length, but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets -- from the Latin cometa, meaning "long-haired" -- are essentially dramatic light shows.      Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system.      Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit. Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley, because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return, based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet returned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to see it.      A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent appearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime. Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.      The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by Halley's Comet in 1986.       Conclusion      Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959, spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space.       We have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects.      The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets, moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.      We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on Earth.      We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future missions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid belt.      We can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not been back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian outposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony! - end -
