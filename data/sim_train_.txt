It would be an extremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available Alphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat. In fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat sinks.

Hi, I am using a dtk 386-20Mhz 13Meg memory to run a variety of programs, and have had problems off and on with lock up, but now I am trying to run an application that wants a lot of memory over a period of time (Playmation 24 bit rendered) and it is  locking up Everytime.  I have an ATI ultra + w/2Meg which I have tried in each of the video modes, I have excluded the region of video memory from A000-C800 segments from the use of emm386, have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to prevent swapping) and I have REM'd ALL TSR's and utilities in config.syus and autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling my HP dashboard.  even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv, no TSR's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still locks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except 3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows screen, but simply does a full reset immediately).  Just about out of ideas, anyone out there have any????  Thanks tom branham

What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I > get round the problem!! Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity, it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just  that. In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns. -joel

  Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in /usr/lpp/GL somewhere... (it's named Glib.c; my IBM's down right now though, so I can't find the exact location :)   WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an X window id from it anyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's turning into a Hard Job.   Check out your "info" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and X, and how to go about doing so.   )Rob

The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system 7 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC?  I recall there being a conversation here that a 486/25 running Windows benchmarks at about the same speed as 25Mhz 030 in system 7.  I don't know if that is true, but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this. -David **** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

> I've seen a lot of different terms, which seem to mean the same > thing.  Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean: > 	-) multi-screen > 	-) multi-headed > 	-) multi-display > 	-) X-Server zaphod mode As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  "multi-headed" tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg, a Sun with a cg4 display).  "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing "multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple Screens. "zaphod" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen. > Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle > (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ? There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing about X. 					der Mouse

:  : Hello, :  : I recently tried to print some envelopes using AmiPro 3.0 with my : Deskjet 500 printer, and I seem to be having a problem.  What : happens is after I physically load the envelope into the printer : (per the user manual) and then select the "Print Envelope" icon : from AmiPro (all of the proper options have been selected), the : printer just "spits out" the envelope without any printing of : either a return address or the selected mailing address.  At : this point, the printer's "ONLINE" light begins to flash, and : the Print Manager shows the printer job as busy.  This is all : that happens, until I either shut the printer off or cancel the : printing job from the Print Manager.  I have also tried this : without the use of the Print Manager, with similar results  : (AmiPro shows the printer as being busy).  So, does anybody : have any idea/solution regarding this problem?  I appreciate : the help.  Thanks. Yes - ignore the manual.  Just insert the evelope - don't use the keypad to move it up.  The Windows driver sends a message to the printer that tells it to load the envelope - if it is already loaded, it gets ejected and the printer tries to load another.  The instructions in the manual are for dumb DOS apps. that don't send the "load envelople" message. :  : -- Tom Belmonte Bob Taylor HP Vancouver

From what I've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting    TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in    the first place. Unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device (image setter).  A problem with TT fonts in Windows is that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even used while this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The result is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution.   So when you print to an attached PS printer, with the PS driver set up for this printer results, may be quite good.  But if you take a PS file made for that printer and run it on a device of different resolution (such as an image setter), then the results may not be so good.

[] 	"These LPT1, COM1, disk controller are call devices.  There are 	devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership, eg. disk 	controller (I6) and keyboard (I1).  There are also devices that 	does not require exclusive ownership, ie. it will share an 	interrupt with another device, eg. LPT1" No.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use, two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to a screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7. When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it's because they're implemented by a single card.

The reason I wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is because of following: I talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told that I can expect a new version near the end of the month. Which should be about now... However, I have a problem when switching back from a DOS session in standard mode. Apparently they don't know of this problem and seem to be surprised why anybody would want to use standard mode at all. It's a great card for the price, at least when I bought it.

Contrary to what others might have thought, I actually did have a SCSI drive once.  It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best I could do with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec. I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM, RLL, and IDE drives because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help needed from the computer's bios.  Dos will see many logical drives, much more than 4 (I've had up to 10).  I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you could hang off a ST-01/02.

Hi Netters, As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0. People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0. (Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0.  However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy. Buddy Christyono ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello Buddy, I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance. Here is my suggestion... 1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with 	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that 	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other 	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you  	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...) 2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95 	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I 	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost! 	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with 	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It 	works great.  Not delays.  I think the "A" is better than "B"  	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance. 	I am looking forward to being able to "LOADHIGH" the DD sw.  That 	has been an annoyance. 3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the 	effort to upgrade. Just my $.02 ... Regards, Mark Bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Buddy, I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly. There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a 203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had ~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such). I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very happy camper. -Bruce --    Bruce F. Steinke                    | "Never know when you're going to   Software Technical Support Engineer |               Sam Gamgee   Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp.   |      <My mail, My Opinions> --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced mode. 	I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache. 	I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install. The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem.  There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive. 	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady  around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files  are compressed image files and some large zip files.   If you have any more specific questions let me know. Dan --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40 MB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the same product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either product. --  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -------------------- END OF MESSAGES --------------------------------------

Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out 2 of the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything because the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM. It only knows 1MB and 2MB. >From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have >16-bit color, is that correct?     Yes, this is correct.

From the 950 documentation, they >seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power >supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?     Yup. You have to take off the power supply.

Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame.  The work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where placed w/no text wrap around).  Unforutnately, once the page run-on has occured you are hosed. So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters to align equation frames. Hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this  problem. Kurt
Here is the story: I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem. Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT, and then telnet out again to the rest of the world. What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do the trick. Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that there aren't going to be any. Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet out again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well... thanks in advance. --  _______________________________________________________________ Benjamin S.

Hi!    I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)    Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)    Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you from physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?    Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you think is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would like to spend under $140, if possible.    Please reply through mail; I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup. If there's interest, I can post a summary of replies. Thanks a lot! M. Scott Smith

hi,   Have you used Mac system 6.x or 7.x? If the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a "mature" OS.   Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example: (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening. Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.   No flame, please.

I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me. The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it.   	In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.     	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other. 	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.                   	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school. 	About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else.  If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.   Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.         - Chung Yang

What I have seen from the March Beta is that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want.  I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on Unix for remote logins.  In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using a "business computer" from IBM or some other established vendor, I would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides the robustness such an application requires.  On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32 based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon. I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32 becomes widely available.  -- Sadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Center for Reliable and High-performance Computing

I have just installed a Diamond Stealth 24 ISA card in a '486DX2-66 system with 256K cache, and 16 megs of memory, that gets about a 126 SI 6.0 CPU Benchmark rating.  Using the 1024x768x16 color driver under Windows, I am getting a Winbench Winmarks rating of only about 9.5 Million.  Since I have heard that others get 15-to-16 million for this card, I assume that something is very wrong with my setup. What are some possible causes of the card slowing down like this? I ran the Qualitas ASQ diagnostic program on memory, and I noted the following memory timings on my machine: ASQ v1.30 by Qualitas  SYSTEM ANALYSIS  Mon Apr 19, 1993  11:43:49AM    page: 1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ACCESS TIMING      Hex     KB     KB   Access Speed Ratio (%)   Start  Start   Size  Time us 0   25   50  75  100      00000      0     32      396 ******************   00800     32     32      598 *****************   01000     64     32      157 ********************   01800     96     32      180 ********************   02000    128     64      157 ********************   03000    192     32      165 ********************   03800    224    128      156 ********************   05800    352     96      169 ********************   07000    448     32      153 ********************   07800    480     32      188 ********************   08000    512     96      158 ********************   09800    608     32      171 ********************   0A000    640     96     1221 **************   0B800    736     32     1581 ************   0C000    768     32      312 *******************   0C800    800     96      154 ********************   0E000    896     64     3957 *   0F000    960     64      312 ******************* Note two things on this chart: 1) The video memory appears to be many orders of magnitude slower than system memory.

I've been reading, with much confusion, about whether or not to use ATManager. Lately, all the packages I've been buying have all included ATManager as a "bonus" I do some desktop publishing using PageMaker and Coreldraw. Coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over 200 diff types. Add that to the TTfonts that come with win31 and you have a decent amount of fonts. I print my creations out on an HP4 Postcript, at 600 dpi resolution with the "Resolution Enhancement  Technology" and ..  well ... I get some darn good copies.  So good that there isn't any diff whether or not ATManager is turned on or not. Is it worth it to run ATM at all? Especially with these better printer technologies ... and TT? --  -- avDean

Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM expansion slot giving you 4MB. The only thing you can do to upgrade to the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion, giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling TechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc.... <==================================+==================================>   Network Manager                  +    Los Alamos National Laboratory

I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits?   be construed as an official comment from the JET project.

   ...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based    formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and    action-based, and the other symbol-based. True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.) I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system.     I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be    categorized as a "symbol manipulator". It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers --- these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not required to do what they do.  To restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions; no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

Hi, 	We've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer (dmp or Laser). I have used Works and Windows Write. The output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output, but anything fancy garbles or just doesn't output. The exception is outputting to a Lserjet 4 which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to bother about handshaking messages. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I've tried most of the Print/Network manager options I can think of. Anyone had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it?? Thanks John Atherton

I just got a Quadra 800 8/230 and I've noticed that I can't change the desktop color from the beautiful gray.  I thought maybe I should reinstall the OS using the "Install Me First, Macintosh Centris, Quadra..." diskette because the system file on this diskette is more recent than the one on the hard disk. The easy install selects "Macintosh Cnetris System Software".  Does anyone know if I should use this or customize and use "System Software for any Macintosh"?  Or does it matter?

Hi,   I recently bought an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280+. It's a real nice card, but I'm having very big problems with it.   The basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display in windows. Something like every other line or so. Also, when I use a DOS gif viewer, namely vpic 6.0c, in Fahrenheit 1280 mode, vertical lines are swapped. It's very strange looking. If it uses VESA standards, however, it works great! only it thinks there's only 512K on the card. (There's 1MB on there).   I have contacted Orchid support, and they tried to be helpful, but didn't have the answer. I don't think the card is the problem, since it works great on my friend's computer.   Here is my setup: Fahrenheit 1280+, 1MB, bios 1.1 386-25, Opti-chipset2, AMI bios 1990, 5MB ram. Maxtor 120MB harddrive, (slave) Maxtor 40Mb harddrive (master) Panasonic c1381 monitor, version 4.6 windows drivers. windows 3.1 I tried taking all memory managers, etc off, and took all other cards (besides disk controller) off.   My friend's setup is 386sx-16, shamrock monitor. If anyone has seen anything like this, or can otherwise help, I will be very greatful. Tony.

We have a Sun 3/80 and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card. The cg8 is supposed to support both a 24-bit color visual and a monochrome visual. The default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome, and we are unable to change it to the 24-bit visual. We have tried using XGetVisualInfo to get a visual of depth 24, but had no success.  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24-bit deep visual, only monochrome.  There are two possible solutions: 	If someone has patches for X11R5 Xsun server, could they forward them to us? 	Otherwise, could someone instruct us how to access the 24-bit color in openwindows? --  Lewis & Clark College Portland, OR 97219

Hi,  I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and I'm observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a DrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. In particular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some XDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction. Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server bug? Thanks, Zack T. Smith

Hello,      I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework.  I have come across a few that look good:   Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise Some considerations I'm using:   Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.   Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.    We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have. The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc). A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are: ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.     Had a better demo :-) Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated, Thanks,   Brett Harper
> >A while ago I posted a note asking for specs on the Quadra 700, and opinions on >the Q700 upgrade of a IIci vs. an accelerator card.  So far no responsed that >I've noticed.  Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade >paths:  Cost, efficiency, pros/cons, etc.. Thanks!   Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent copy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:   25 MHz 68040   16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower       than Q 950 style machines for sure).   Ethertalk card on-board   Audio in/out   4 MB RAM on motherboard   4 SIMM slots   2 NuBus slots.   More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM. In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you   audio or ethernet  or the same video options.   With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I   think it ends up costing more. Greg Dudek

Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups.  Note that the NeXT does this: you can always telnet into a NeXT and run character-based apps but you can't run the GUI.

I'm concerned about the 4-planes...I've only ever heard of 1 (mono) and 8 (colour) planes -- will I have any concerns with this 4-plane unit?  [Specifically related to 4-planes vs 1 or 8] Thanks! -C- PS: all R5 apps run on R4/R3 servers,right?

The ability to program was >an entry requirement. At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming)  start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000  assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and  Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company  for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special  Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).   The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering  (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing  Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where  students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an  outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change  suddenly).   In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and  exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a  30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework  assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this? BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

>In PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI, >20% faster than IDE, and support up to 7 devices its acceptance ...has >long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches." I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re: performance. Where do they get those numbers? I'll list the actual performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a statement is absurd: SCSI-I ranges from 0-5MB/s. SCSI-II ranges from 0-40MB/s. IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s. ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)
Do all SCSI cards for DOS systems require a separate device driver to be loaded into memory for each SCSI device hooked up?  Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's? Thanks. Randy

   Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position    and the window at a position below it.    This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current    configuration and restore is later.    Currently, my solution is: 	   XCreateWindow(...); 	   XSetWMProperties(..); 	   XMapWindow(...); 	   XFlush(...); 	   XMoveWindow(...);    It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering    if I'm overlooking something obvious.    Richard. I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the "user" window. Maybe other window managers have similar options. Another way to figure out the difference between the "user" window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way. Greeting,
I've heard about Ottomenu which should be a good desktop on Windows 3.0/3.1 .  Can anybody tell me where I can get it ? It should be on CICA in /pub/pc/win3/util but it is not. It is also not an WUSTL,SIMTEL and a great number of other sites. Just post it or mail me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 				Andreas Gloege 			Kazmaierstr.48 (bei Klarmann) 				8000 Muenchen 2 				  089/508336 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi.  My last question for the year.  I have a mail-order no-name notebook with 4 meg ram.  I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview, but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me, most commonly citing a "memory parity error."  The only thing I can do is TURN OFF and re-boot.  My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup, and there is never a problem with this either. Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware?  I remember having some disk error problems when installing it. Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening (I think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but both crash frequently nonetheless) I know this is a pain, but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home account doesn't have rn.  And I will stop asking questions now.  Thank you.
I am a novice (at best) in working with pc networks, and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business. The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system. My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup. Well, this all seems too easy to me.  Would any of you network gurus out there tell me if I am out of my mind here?  Any and all suggestions, however trivial, will be immensely appreciated.  My apologies if this has been brought up before. Thanks! John -- --

I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I  trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the  least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a  horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data  integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you  have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on  it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I  don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S  internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'. -t

Occasionally when I try to wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on the screen - it freezes. I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at startup. I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times already and finally they agreed something is astray after my Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't afford to be without my Duo at this time.

There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices. This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre- tations.  Your mileage may vary.

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for easier cleaning. If the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the new ergonomic mouse? By open, I mean split the two halves to get at the guts. It isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw heads. Mark

Calling XMapWindow and then XFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the window manager.

And what if the window manager refuses to move your window? --

Subject: --- CR-ROM Drive Recommendation? --- Hi all,   I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is:    * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD    * SCSI(2) Interface    * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B    * Does not need any caddies    * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible)    * Double Speeded   I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,   so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions   are sorted by my priority.   I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy   almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know   the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these   NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible   with 1542B adapter.   Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Kobayashi,Masaoki
> What's the difference between loading mouse.com in autoexec.bat and > doing device=mouse.sys in config.sys?? The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com. > which one is better? mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it. The working of both drivers is totally the same. When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat, because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone, because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded. Michael --

I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.) I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s. Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card. It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!) So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,  Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card. Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate. Why? Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM? Is there anything I can do? --David +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ | David Blume            | "I get tired thinking of all the things I  | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS. In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible. When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly. I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the transmission is error free. But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors. Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing). I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me. Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason I don't understand. Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump? Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE. I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos, or just me. Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also, According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows. Please help me figure out what's going on... Scott Petrack

The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options,  including NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port and a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.   The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of these have an FPU.   In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes me now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and "Quadra" comparable video speed. No idea if it has an FPU.   Hope this helps... Beth Corbo
How hot should the CPU in a 486-33 DX machine be? Currently it gets so hot that I can not hold a finger on it for more than 0.5 s.  I keep a big fan blowing on it, but am considering using a heat sink. Any advice? --  Chris Kushmerick --I found my niche in life, I just didn't fit in.
I have a Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250 tape backup unit in my Gateway 486/33V Tower system. I have found the supplied backup capability to be  fairly unreliable. In approx 3 cases out of 10, I have had the backup fail at one point or another, often hanging in the middle of writing the tape. Seek errors, drive communication errors seem to be most common. I use the DOS backup software from Colorado Memory Systems. Should I return the drive, get some better backup software, reformat the tapes (am using CMS tapes)? Any hints would be appreciated - this stuff is to time-consuming to do over and over again until it cooperates... Steve Norman
Hi all,                Could anybody please tell me where I might be able to find device drivers  for a couple of older Gateway ethernet cards?  I don't have the model number off hand, but they have only a BNC connector, and a header connector for  a Novell keycard (one has one installed).       I'm looking at using these with a 2 node copy of 10-net that I picked up at a swap meet.  (I'd love to do Lantastic or Netware lite, but I'm a poor college student and the price was right.)     Please reply via email, as I haven't had a lot of time for news because of exams and such.  
I just picked up a second-hand "color option" for the NEC P5200 24pin dot matrix printer.  Alas, there were no installation instructions, so I am totally confused on WHY it WON'T GO IN!

Hi ! I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter. I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color. The problem is that my top level frame created as 	frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL); seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas. I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits. I tried using the following Xlib code : XVisualInfo visual_info; int depth = 24; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attribs; unsigned long valuemask = 0; Window *win; Xv_opaque frame; win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID); XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info); /* So far so good */ colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone); /* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */ attribs.colormap = colormap; valuemask |= CWColormap; XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs); XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap); Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ? Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay. Thanks again, Alok. --- ALOK MATHUR Computer Science & Engg, Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 11414 Fairchild Road, #2, Cleveland, OH 44106
>How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at >130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at >just over 1Mb/s. How about 250MB/s for 64-bit VLB or 350MB/s for QuickRing {Apple's implimentation of VLB (Byte 10/92:132)} QuickRing is interesting in that it allows interleaving with other card so that the 350MB/s can be divided  among many cards at the same time {NuBus 90 and MCA are about the only card  interfaces able to DO anything with that kind of speed and even NuBus 90 ditzes around at ~30MB/s with a burst mode: 80MB/s. "MCA {Also called Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one CPU in a computer"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, >>as fast as the two components   involved can handle it.<< Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). IDA can't handle VLB speed never mind QuickRings's speed so it is out. EISA pokes along at NuBus Mac II speeds {~15MB/s burst mode: 33MB/s}  so VLB and QuickRing are slowed down by it. PCI is a competing interface that is still in development.

I am getting Garbled output when serial printing thru Windows & works etc.  This has occurred on several systems and goes if a LaserJet 4 is used.  I suspect that there is no need for handshaking in this case due to the capacity (memory/speed) of it.  There is no problem printing from DOS.  Are there any obvious tweaks I'm missing.  I'm sure its not JUST me with this problem.  Thanks for reading....  John Atherton

>This is an aside to Brian Hughes's (please, let's lose the cute phony names >everybody) posting about adding memory to a Quadra 800.     What phony names? My name is clearly visible in the headers, and I sing the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that, then you will have to get over it. I've used this account name for over 10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7 generally recognize "Hades" as my account name. I have no intention of changing the way I post. >I installed a couple of 16MB SIMMs in my Quadra and was somewhat dismayed >by the general complexity of the operation compared to, for example, the >wonderfully designed LC III. It irritates me when Apple refuses to tell how >to do it in the User's Manual so you have to guess at how to disassemble >the devise in question (it's the same for adding memory to LaserWriter >Pro's).     It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you about the LW Pro design. >The operation isn't very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were >offered but Apple leaves you working blind.     Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no longer valid. >After the memory was installed I was distraught that the top of the SIMMs >came into contact with the plastic case frame. Mine actually contacted the >framework with quite a lot of pressure -- enough so that the assembly of >the board back to the proper position was rather difficult and required >some force. I could have filed a little excess material off the top of the >SIMM boards but chose to let it stand as is. I have not had problems with >RAM yet so I will consider the problem annoying but not catastrophic.     This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure. -Hades

Hey everybody:    I want to buy a mac and I want to get a good price...who doesn't?  So, could anyone out there who has found a really good deal on a Centris 650 send me the price.  I don't want to know where, unless it is mail order or areound cleveland, Ohio.  Also, should I buy now or wait for the Power PC. Thanks.

	I'm looking for a Cache card for my IIsi. I can spend $250 Max for it, 	what i need is 64 kb cache with a fpu socket and a dual slot adapter. 	Or at least a passe_through connector so i can keep my graphic card. 	I need your advice about the best card i can buy. How much performance 	increase i should expect, does the performance increase between the 	32 and 64 kb Cache worths the price difference ?. And what's the best 	price i can get for such a card (i really need to spare each possible 	$).  	I have an Ethernet card for the LC with fpu. I don't think it would 	work for the IIsi but the fpu is socketed. Do you think i can take the 	fpu out of the card and put it in the empty fpu socket ?. Would it work 	at 20 Mhz ?. If not, how much should i pay for an extra fpu ?. --     Ya jamal(al) majd(i) fi(l) kutub(i) |Lab de Genie Informatique (LGI).  Kablak(i) (t)tareekh(u) fi thulmaten    |IMAG, INPG.

Hi! When posting Winmark results, it is a good idea to give the version of  WinBench that you used to obtain the scores, as well as the resolution that you tested and the version of the drivers. Eric Balog

   Oh yeah, I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a    high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitors.(the Sony    1604S for example) and this is where the extra cost comes from.  It    is also where the high bandwidth comes from, and the fantastic    image, and the large image size, etc, etc... It's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third down, the other two thirds down) come from. - Tony
Subject: "SIMM Re-use" NuBus board... Anyone seen one? 	Hello, 	I remember running across an ad in the back of Mac[User|World] a few years ago, for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots, to be used to "recycle your old SIMMs," when you upgraded memory.  I don't remember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised in any of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included software to make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS  he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly good idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?   Are they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used one if they are no longer made?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please e-mail me, to save net.bandwidth. 	Thanks, 	Cap. --     CONSILIO MANUQUE     OTIUM CUM DIGNITATE     CREDO QUIA ABSURDUM EST         PARTURIENT MONTES NASCETUR RIDICULUS MUS

	These drivers (updated) are available directly from Diamond. 	they will even ship them to you at no charge.(at least they  	did for me.)
Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card Several problems: 1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB    of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED    with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM. 2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:    a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.    b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK). 3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The    Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.    Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen    is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter    "R". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it    does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.    The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive    behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with    Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles    the VGA mode.        The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use    another monitor in place of my usual one. I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). --- swh, 20apr93
Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART's built in (rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)? My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway). It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives. Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with 16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so it could co-exist with my existing card. Does such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia, preferably Brisbane? Thanks,
I've acquired an old Logitech Series 7 (3-button) mouse, and I'm told that this is a bus mouse.  Does anyone want to unload an old (pc-clone) bus-card for this mouse? thanks.

Hi.  I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra 900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated. When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types of sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH speakers: system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record) Armor Alley Spectre Spaceward Ho! But, the following games only play out of the left channel: Lemmings Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW) Glider 4.0 OIDS But still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers. (The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?)) All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run OOTW because he doesn't have color). We're both running system 7.1 Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or greater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine? I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be mistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB 170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)? Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge), so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1 patch over this problem?) Thanks for any help you can provide! Doug Book
What is hardware handshaking and when do I want to use it? Dan
Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for $649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one. Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem. Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100. I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.) It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.  I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.) What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future. Bill Krauthammer PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service has been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says the board is a "391 WB/H."  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card. 	Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of. My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays "Parity Error -- System Halted" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error Checking to "disabled" or "enabled" in the setup of the bios (makes sense). Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?). 	I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures). 	I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid. 	My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid). 	CAN ANYONE HELP? Thanks, Peace, David Geller

However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible). This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale. SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something). There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.). Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]). Phil Ryan Melbourne, Australia
------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anonymous, I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50. I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing, but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that faster...  I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times  as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)! regards, JV                                                                 ///// name:    J-V Meuldijk                                          [ o o ] address: gildelaar 4                                            \_=_/          4847 hw teteringen                                     _| |_  _____________________________________________________________oOOO___OOOo__

They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use IRQ7!.      The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7, then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip, thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.      Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!. Windows may be a different story....

XT drives usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I think).

I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426  chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu  (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so. From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons  (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the  following for the sake of comparison: 							Wintach              		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65 Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of  the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review. Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the  DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120  drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s,  I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at  least that was what the program said. Oliver Weatherbee
   I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX    platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,    or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?    "Motif" includes Xt in this context. Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal.    One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have    already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be    a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.    Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)? I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this as an alternative.    Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they    could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!    Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not    yet have the spec)? Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD  widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list you could port. --

The first and easiest to fix is interference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or other electrical device.  Try moving the system to another location to fix that problem. Second, because of the scan rate of the monitor, it tends to synchronize with room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing.  Try turning off all lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.  If not, try moving the system somewhere else. A third solution would be to get a 14" Apple Color Display - It should not have the same problem the 12" Color is more suceptible to. You can try calling Apple's new support number (in the U.S.) at 1-800-SOS-APPLE. This number is for ANYONE who has questions regarding Macintosh setup and compatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on Monday, April 5, 1993.

> Given a program running on a workstation with an X based window > system, how can one pop the window in which it is running to the top. > By window I mean the terminal window from which it was invoked. One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if it does it may be in no condition to be "pop[ped] to the top" (eg, it may be iconified).  And even if you can, it may not do what you want - consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real desktop. Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window on a different server, for example. 					der Mouse

I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me. I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since I don't have much experience with programming X, I thought this issue might be helpful as it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors in programming X. At the end of the errors section, there are the following references for tutorials on X programming style.  They are: Rosenthal, David -   A simple X11 client program   Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference, 1988. Lemke, D., and Rosenthal, D. -  Visualizing X11 clients   Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference, 1989. Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably) electronic form? Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to programming X (I'll be looking at the bookstore for books, so I am really only asking about what I can find on the net.) Thanks, David Simpson

It is rumored to have an integrated file and program manager.  DOS 7 is rumored to be similar to Chicago but without the GUI.

Just taken delivery of a 66MHz 486 DX2 machine, and very nice it is too. One query - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something MHz - thats not the problem. The problem is the speed when turbo is off. Its 7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button that turns it into a skateboard. Does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of turbo vs non-turbo?? I would like to set it to give a landmark speed of about 30 or 40 MHz with turbo off.

I had the same question for my 55lb NEC 5FG monitor. The Apple guy said that their 50lb 16" monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment beyond that. I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to  thinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight would be more concentrated than with Apple's (I don't know the area of the  base of their tilt/swivel). Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle. So I cut a piece of 3/8" thick wood to about 16.25" x 12", covered it in a  cream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's top and the monitor!!      **************** I HATE *CHIPSOFT'S* MacINTAX *******************
Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...   If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:   I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen.   I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction.   Details:   Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card: ---------------------------------------------------   **SOLD**   Sony 1304 14" color monitor: ---------------------------- What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY, Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point). It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen, and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.   Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.     RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM): ------------------------------------------------------------------ Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13" monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode (you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg SIMMS).   Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking **$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundled offer" for these items.   ------------   Cheers.  --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been: Univ. of Texas, Austin |  b.

We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully started we run an xterm as the "console" - the problem is that any messages that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  "Refresh window" fails to remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of the screen obscuring anything else below them. At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1. We're running X in color, and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are on the B/W framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted. My question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid of these messages? Hugh McIntyre. INMOS Ltd., Bristol, UK. (BTW: SunOS 4.0.3, X11R5, mwm). PS: I know I can redirect output of the relevant commands to /dev/null - I'm     looking for a more general solution).
To all hardware and firmware gurus: My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a  physically handicapped relative of mine.  My goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World at its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be  expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be  willing to point me in the right direction.  I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB gives most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes  and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it  leaves a number of important questions unanswered. 1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm     guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either     event, how is the data framed? 2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "AT     keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)? If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in the event of a booboo. Thank you for your time.

Hi all: Does anyone know where I can get the cheapest price for the Teleport Gold fax modem by Global Village? Any answer will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Regards, Thian.
|  I have a Sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the |  motherboard.  The same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?) |  daughterboard.  I have been using this system with a color monitor having a |  color "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the |  bwtwo1, both on the same tube.  I recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 Sun mono |  monitor, and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and |  the bwtwo0.  I do not care if I loose the "back" screen on the color tube |  from the bwtwo1.  After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if |  this is possible.  Has anybody sucessfuly done this before? If it's any consolation, I have two 2-headed Sun-3/60 systems, though the color and mono monitors for each are "rated" 1152x900.   Their configuration is the same as yours, so it "should" be a Plug'N'Play situation, EXCEPT: I don't know if your hi-res mono monitor will function this way.  However, you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HI-RES jumper (located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAM/SIMM selects and Ethernet connection) and be happily on your way.  When you pull the motherboard, the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. "north-west") quadrant of the motherboard (to the left of the SIMM sockets).
Hi there, I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on this but I could not get precise answers. On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of 32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have? On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM. I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that both machines have 16-bit color capability. Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950? From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have 16-bit color, is that correct? Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power supply to access the VRAM SIMMs? Thanks for your help! -- Daniel Salber, User Interface Research Team, LGI-IMAG, Grenoble, France.
While playing around with my Gateway 2000 local-bus machine last night, it became apparent that Windows 3.1 didn't give the option for 32-bit access for virtual memory. I am using a permanent swap file, and the disk drive is on the local bus interface. Is this expected, or should I be investigating further why no 32-bit option appears? Thanks for any help. -- Scott Linn

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff is big enough to warrant changing. For instance, I'll be upgrading my 486 33 to a 486DX-2 66 EISA, VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux) is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're fast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper.

In evolution of 80-x86 data path width has been doubled from  8 to 16 t0 32 bits but the speed of data processing has not increased at same rate.The question is Why? What is relationship bettween data path width and data processing speed? Thanks in advance for the input. Robert. 
(please respond via email!) Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net. The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me). The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors. We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around  in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have  no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the  above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail  for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have. Any hints? Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

Does your Stealth 24 have a row of DIP switches on the back plane? If so, you have the older Revision A board and the winmark results are absolutely normal. The later Revision B board benchmarks at 13 to 15 million winmarks (at least mine does in 486DX-50 toy). V

Make sure you're using "ssetroot", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an "ssetroot" after tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&") You can also use "VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename" or just VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey. > ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised >     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters. Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export. All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following: The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized. Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed characters in an xterm to get passed.) Anyone have a fix for the last two? --Dave --  System Administrator, Penn State Population Research Institute * Dog Dianetics ("Woof woof woof?  Page 725.") - Kibo
I know of two people who have horrer stories about the DOS 6.0.  That's 100% of the people I know with DOS 6.0. Both have had to reformat their disks and start over.  One had drive D compress and work fine, only to compress C: to have the thing choke, spit out an unintelligable warning, and then hang.  All that was left on either drive was autoexec.bat and config.sys.  Calls to Microsoft only met with busy signals.  After reformatting the drive, I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known entity. The other may have been a marginal drive, however, his upgrade failed, he had to format a floppy disk at 6.0, format the drive, and then reinstall. I make now claims since I was not driving at the time, however, be careful and make sure you back important things up. I am interested in any other people with similar or success stories.....
I'm posting this for a friend that runs a BBS. I'm not sure if its under DOS or Windows. He is interested in a board that has 16 ports on it. In another post, someone suggeted a DigiBoard, but didn't have too much info on it. Could someone give me information on any boards that they know of with the before mentioned configuration. Models. Specifications. Prices.  Manufacturers. Thanks, Rob -- Computer Science Dept. University of Minnesota

I think I have the same problem. I think it is caused by the rubber ball in the mouse, which doesn't roll so smooth. The detectors in the mouse notice this and whoops, I hit a mine (using minesweeper :-) ). I think the solution will be buying a new mouse, and/or using a mouse pad. Wouter.
No doubt this is an old question, but I didn't find the answer in the FAQs I could find, so - here goes: I have a Sunview application that I want to convert to X (OpenLook, Motiv, whatever). I remember hearing quite some time ago that there are tools to accomplish this task. 	a) is that so? 	b) are they public domain? 	c) any good, i.e. 	d) advantages over reimplementing the interface myself? Thanks, -- Alex
While there are too many PS clones to count, some of which are quite poor, trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience. Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this. Q:	Which version of Adobe PS will we clone? 	Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released 	new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other 	software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure 	you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to 	dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to 	maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3. Q:	Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly? 	From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had 	a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding 	which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate. Q:	Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation? 	Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's 	PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does 	leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be 	nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two 	different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given 	an identical set of conditions. Q:	PSCRIPT.DRV? 	Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of 	testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary 	source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files, 	(1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal, 	but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe 	uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its 	wrong. Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS is.
Okay, I don't use it very much, but I would like for it to keep working correctly, at least as long as Apple continues to make System software that will run on it, if slowly :-) Here is the problem:  When the screen is tilted too far back, vertical lines appear on the screen.  They are every 10 pixels or so, and seem to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus. It looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection between the screen and the rest of the computer. I am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer, or taking this one to the shop.  I would also like to not have to buy one of Larry Pina's books.  I like Larry, but I'm not sure I feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual for it. On a related note:  what does the monitor connector connect to? Erik
Eric, send me your email address, I lost it! I've reconsidered! Kevin

Hello folks, I'm seeing these errors when I try to modify my key map: mwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x I've added a line in the start up file before the line that starts mwm. It looks like the following: xmodmap keymapfile mwm I think that the problem has to do with a conflict between function keys F1 through F7 which already have assigned functions (e.g. Move, Minimize, etc). The odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run xmodmap keymapfile from an xterm. Can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically F1 through F7 AND not have mwm (Motif Window Manager) complain. I realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to implement, not time to learn how to implement. Terry
you Need gs252ini.zip and 24*.zip, and 25*.zip font files. You can get these from  wuarchive.wustl.edu /mirrors/msdos/postscript. I also advice you to get gs252gui.zip from CICA. It is a nice interface for ghostscript. Ghostscript is very user unfriendly. This interface makes it user friendly. For using this interface you have to get vbrun100.dll (from risc.ua.edu /pub/network/misc) copy this to your windows directory. Copy gui executables and other files to your ghostscript directory. And anter the line below to your autoexec.bat. SET GS_LIB=C:\<your ghostscript and gui directory> Now you are ready to use it. Enjoy it. e.edu (Steve W Brewer) writes: >What files do I need to download for GhostScript 2.5.2?  I have never used >GhostScript before, so I don't have any files for it.

Hi there! I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display card for driving a 14" multisync (NEC 3D)? The NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz and vertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced, though I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624 noninterlaced. It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite freely within these limits and is capable to display at least 8bits/pixel, preferably more. Is there anything on the market that comes even close? Thanks -- Jartsu
Hi there, I think it is time to create a MS DOS 6.0  FAQ since lots of questions about it are actually flooding the net.  I won't be able to write it my self because of the lack of time/knowledge/experience. Perry Egelmeers
OK, I'll try one more time with this one. If ANYONE out there has ANY information on MicroScience hard drives and how to set the jumpers (and where they are?) for master/slave configurations. I will gladly accept any info, as I have a 110M'er sitting in my room collecting dust just waiting for me to install huge applications. :) Thanks in advance. (And yes, I regulary check the IDE Harddisk Spec that is posted here.)

I previously stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen just to make sure that my image had data, and it did.

A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs or true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory (total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder comes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods mentioned above). Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got this information: %%% Memory info %%% Physical RAM size: 20480K. Logical RAM size: 20480K. Addressing mode: 32bit mode in use. 32 bit System zone: Absent. Parity RAM: Not capable. Temporary memory support: Present. Note that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem? How can I turn this on?  Any ideas? Can anyone help? Ken

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup. 	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the  newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in  their source distributions of X11. 	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has  		send fixes # where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch. 	Here are a few complications: 	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and  "5d" separately 	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was  re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris] 	3) fix 8 is in two parts: "8a" and "8b" 	4) fix 13 is in three parts: "13a", "13b", and "13c" 	5) fix 16 is in two parts: "16a" and "16b" 	6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which  previously was optional 	7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for "PEXlib.uu.[1234]". 	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, "22a" through "22i" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail  it a request, and it mails back the response. 	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can  have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help).  The xstuff server treats the "Subject:" header line just like any other line  of the message. 	The archives are organized into a series of directories and  subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an  index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the  subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it. 	1) The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to send you a  more detailed version of this help file. 	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is "index", then  the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then  the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index.  For example, you can say "send index fixes" (or "index fixes"). A message that  requests an index cannot request data. 	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is "send", then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name  an item, you give its directory and its name. For example                 send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 	You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many  safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large  amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the  day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day.  Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out  shortest-first. 	4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting  return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If  you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like or         path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it. your mailer deals in "!" notation, try sending to  {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

I wonder what window manager the writer had  > in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps. Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers would make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority. The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup.

Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT. I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather, colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's called under X11R5). If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer. Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps? --  		Evans & Sutherland

Surely some one of you is familiar with what a mail-order company goes through. This company has only a few products, but thousands of clients. I need a Sales, Billing, and Receivables program to handle the thing, but I need to be able to customize it myself, own the source, etc. Anyone willing to sell me the basic stuff (in ANY development language) I'll be willing to pay about $1,000 to.  It has to be ready now. I need this sort of solution immediately. With more time I'll just develop one myself. If you can have me a prototype in two weeks, you can make some quick cash. ************************************************************************* | Dixon Berry                       "I see the light                    | | Eastern Illinois University        [thanks Bill Clinton]              | | Booth Library                      Someone please tell me             | | Computer Resource Center             it's not a train                 | |                                                -- Cracker             | *************************************************************************

Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about 3 minutes to warm up.   Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the  CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait  for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight). If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again, the display works as normal like before. Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet. I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer. Thanks a lot.

There would have to be another  difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.  I've often used  memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever.  As long as it's as fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine. Just out of curiosity, did you actually try this and see a problem, or  were you told it wouldn't work and so never tried it?  Also out of  curiosity, do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to (as  I'd like to find out what they're basing this recommendation on). - Dale Adams   Apple Computer, Inc.
  1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.  My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know of an inexpensive program to do this?  ( I have seen formatters for <$20 buit have no idea if they will work)   2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which the back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar mechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know of an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1   all help and advice appriciated.

No.  Even if you could, the answer could be out of date even before you get it (even if you grab the server, it could be taken up by buffering user actions).  You should just try to do whatever you want; a BadAlloc error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available. 					der Mouse

What are the current products available to upgrade the resolution? Which ones support postscript? Any experiences with them, either good or bad? Is the quality difference really noticable? I'm planning on producing camera ready copy of homes.  Will the higher resolution be noticed for these?
> > I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented > data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better > (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when > managing data from a single SCSI hard drive. I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents... The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems. A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group. Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE. --   Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.

That computer went off to grad school with my son and I replaced it with a 486DX2/66 pkg 4 (345 MBHD, 16MB ram) with Diamond Viper, 128K level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the CTX monitor.  I got a 17" HP D1193A monitor employee purchase.  This is a *great* system, fast, quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up.  Tech support seems  busier now than 2 years ago.  I called with a configuration question, and they called back 4 hours later with the right answer.  I think there's a slight premium over Gateway prices, but IMHO Zeos is worth it. BTW they  have enough 800 lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales, customer service, or tech support. Now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes to talk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.  --  Al DeVilbiss
> 1) What is a 16550 UART? I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.  > 2) What does it do for high-speed modems? > 3) Is it necessary for 14.4k or higher throughput? If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.  The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts. > 4) Is it only for internal modems? NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board. > If you have any experience with 9600 or higher speed modems, please > let me know what you think.

Hi, I wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of its childs. If it is not, then how could it be possible to implement a  rubberband across multiple xwindows to select the objects that are displayed one in each window? Hauke
  I am not sure whether I am here in the right area, but does  anybody here know whether Windows NT does/will include a X  Windows server so that it can run X Window applications  remotely? This is because we are considering at our university  to use PC's for word processing and program development,  whereas the bigger jobs are to be run either on SUN  workstations or on Fujitsu super computers.

My wife has one of these.  I have not had much chance to fiddle with it, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, she complains that the print is too light for her taste.  The difference is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is adjusted to the darkest possible level.  I don't find it objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some people don't care for it and it is considerably different.  I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black vs. write-white engines when dealing with TeX drivers.  Is something like that going on here?
MG>> 	I went buying SIMMs recently, and the sales person told me that  the MG>> are 9-chip SIMMs and 3-chip SIMMs, and one cannot use them interchan MG>> If you use one, you have to use all of the same type. don't believe everything you are told.  I can tell you that mixing them  between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless  they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one  bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that  the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent  configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit  nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte  ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent  because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM  interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry  if too techie for ya]. MG>> 	Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to  gi MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG>> 16MB ?? That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit  wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?   Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit  CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data  from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when  it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard  links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in  this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means  that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you  have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide  data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks  are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data  with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by  one SIMM at a time. Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your  question was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.' -rdd     ---  . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is  not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications. As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one. This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has  certainly proved that.

The condition of the Ctrl key BEFORE you press the mouse button makes no difference whatsoever.  You have to be holding the Ctrl key when you RELEASE the mouse button if you want to force a copy operation. Here's a simple experiment.  Select a file and begin to drag it (no Ctrl key).  Notice that the file's icon disappears from the listing window.  Now watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the Ctrl key (keeping the mouse button pressed all the while).  In addition, the icon that you are dragging will show a "+" while you are holding the Ctrl key, indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved. -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories

The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs, New Mexico State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  The archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical Research. The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address is 128.123.1.12 but may change, so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever possible). Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and clr.nmsu.edu.  The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research. The Arabic, Chinese, French, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Tibetan, and Vietnamese archives will all be moved. We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once the archives have been moved. Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  It will take a few days to move everything. If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives, we have been slowly collecting various software, fonts, and text for different languages over the past 2 years.  Most of the software is currently Unix oriented.  We would also like to encourage people to continue to contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and quantity of multi-lingual tools.

There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this) Besides, like I said before, the FDD controller uses DMA channel #2. And I don't yet believe that the HDD controllers (any of them, MFM, RLL, etc) don't also use DMA.

H E L P ! I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day... Some background about my PC: - American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM - config.sys file: 	device=c:\dos\himem.sys 	dos=high,umb 	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems 	files=30 	buffers=30 	stack=9,256 - autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c - CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram. The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31 I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL. Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place for windows. Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them: - Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some   number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means?  I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help. Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running. Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try anything. -------------- Steve Chu AT&T Bell Labs Holmdel, NJ

Has anyone found a fix for the following problem? Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5 Server Hardware:	Sun IPC Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37) A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users. I have tried the following things:     1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).     2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.     3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang. Repeat By: This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times. Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up) Click and release on a menu item Repeat until application hangs Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. -- Skip Koppenhaver

Hi! I think VGA-Copy can do what you need.  If you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4"), turn on the "modify" switch of vga-copy. When you boot using this diskette, a message appears: This is no system disk, you can 1) replace disk with another, 2) boot from Harddisk or 3) switch drives and reboot (that is, a: becomes b:, b: becomes a:) Type your choice: When you select the third item, you can boot from b: which is now called a: . Seems to work very good, for example booting drdos6 from the installation disks in 3.5" format was no problem for a friend of mine (I have only a 3.5" a: drive) Hope that helps Robert --  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |  Robert Fuhge,  Haagstrasse 17,  8520 Erlangen,  Tel. privat: 09131/204103  | +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |  "Wars are not for to see who is right, but who is left ...

Hey folks, on the course to develope a X window application, we encountered a problem. How could I transform a X window bitmap into a postscript files ? Is there any library routines or source code I can call to do the job ? Thank you in advance. p.s. Email reply please. I seldom read this newsgroup. =)
I would appreciate the driver name from CICA which functions as a 256 color driver for a Quadtel video card. The type of chip or chipset used would suffice as well.
if you have a memory card installed that's not one of apple's, this may be the problem.  for a couple of months after the release of the duo, some memory manufacturers were shipping duo memory cards w/ improper (non-self-refreshing) chips.  if you have a third party  card, pull it and see if the sleep problem recurs.   - tim

System 7.1 should not have that problem, for most people the  solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor.  In my case MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my Quadra 700, all that occured early last year. Michael S.

I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory upgrade. I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi at Apple Customer Assistance.  She tells me that those who purchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For those who don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi  or greyscale (at 300dpi). If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their hardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance  1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number). Regards, Glenn P.S. - personally, I'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  They really have an obligation to provide this information to all of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original  configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask for things like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed,  I'm going to write Apple and complain.

Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card? We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the system, and lets crash the Mac then. Okay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate errors in the 68000. Before every instruction some specified registers are masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits. Normally, the "crash instance" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card crash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system. The documentation of A/ROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior when crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing the assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy. So, can anyone help? Please only reply via email, as I don't read this group. --   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      _                   Department of Computer Science IV     / \     |\/|         University of Dortmund, Germany  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  "In the beginning God created Adam ... ahem! ... atoms.

What "it may think is right" may be exactly what the user wants. Assuming that your application "has reason to know better" is, IMHO, anti-social.  If I start your application with a -geometry option are you going to ignore that as well? There's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything if it's managing your window.  You can ask, you can hint, but there's no guarantee that you're going to get what you want. --

Excuse me if this is a frequent question, I checked in several FAQs but couldn't really find anything. I have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want (need) to add additional memory.  But I'm on a budget. I really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is the best (performance wise) and most economical way to do this?  Someone told me that I should only use SIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg, 4 2 meg, etc.  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg and use the rest of what I already have?  The manual hasn't been very helpful with this. Thanks.

Yet, Write does >display the font correctly on the screen. This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver, but I've found it to be pretty generic. You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of pels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a different value. The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not smiling.) -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories
[again, poseted for a friend] Okay, I got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone),  lets try again: How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only? I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color. Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application. So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly... Any ideas?

Is anyone out there running a MS-DOS system with a LocalTalk board? I am on an Appletalk network, hooked up with a DayStar Digital LT200 MC LocalTalk Interface Board, running on a PS/2 Model 70. I'm using the AppleShare PC software for file server and network access. It works fine under DOS or the Window or OS/2 DOS box. But when I try to load it *before* Windows, so that every application I run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as soon as I start up an application. And of course, things look pretty hopeless for OS/2 (but who knows).  So, does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup? - Duncan

It would be interesting for Apple to come out with a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I  guess that's getting a bit fantastic! I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with PowerPCs on a NuBus card. Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the  estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines at a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it's true. Finally, is the PowerPC developer's CD 'mini-course' available? I saw it  advertised in the developer's university calendar, and I'd like to know if it's at all *interesting*. Sean --------------
I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.   I have a number of X level questions regarding this: (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be  predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well). I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given this: 	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple 	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's 	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between 	screens? 	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate 	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? 	What are they; who sells them... 	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a 	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next? 	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see 	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware 	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0? 	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a 	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single 	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate 	multiple screens instead)?   	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely 	on providing config files which will specify for each 	configuration the screen placement of each window in the 	application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience 	are more than welcome. ======================================================================== Jo Pelkey                                   Phone: (509)375-6947 Battelle Pacific Northwest Labs             Fax:   (509)375-3641 P.O.

If I understand your problem correctly, you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib graphics on the window. It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects, you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look.

If you're willing to do a little work, you can make DrawnButtons do what you want, more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that in our internal LYMB system. We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence. Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You can make things look circular enough. -- "Why can't X be this easy?" -- me, after learning about dlopen()

Hi Xperts, this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-( I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)... I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!  As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit: 	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item, 	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes 	 */ 	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152), 	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182), which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0. Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview... Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem?  Any help is very much appreciated. Yuri

Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My computer from Gateway is freezing up on me. Gateway tech support couldn't help me. They want more specifics on when it freezes up.  I DID!  Anyway, here it is.

This will happen almost every time, whether I've just booted up, reset, or finished using a dos program.  Everything works fine if I don't let it sit.  Windows is a different story.  If I let the machine sit while in windows for 15 minutes or more, it does not freeze up.  However,  I do get frequent application errors that kick me out of an application unexpectedly, losing my work. I just don't know if this is a hardware or software problem.

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems. (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like 		/**/#This is a makefile 	at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C 	preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that 	I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the 	line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the 	start of a directive.  	However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol 	as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines 	that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my 	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better 	fix.

I edited a few newsgroup from that line (don't like to crosspost THAT much).  I can't compare the two, but I recently got an HP DeskJet 500. I'm very pleased with the output (remember that I'm used to imagens, laser and postscript printers at school -- looks very good.  You have to be careful to let it dry before touching it, as it will smudge. The deskjet is SLOW.  This is in comparison to the other printers I mentioned.  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares. The interface between Win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, I've not had any problems with it. Hope that helps some. --Cindy -- Cindy Tittle Moore

Hello netters, 	I have a question concerning SCSI on DOS. 	I have a ST01 SCSI controller and two hard-disks conected 	(id's 0 and 1). I'd like to connect a SCSI streamer, but I 	don't have software to access it. Does such a beast exist 	as shareware or PD ? 	 	Also what if I want a third disk ? I know that DOs only can 	"see" two two physical and four logical disks. Will it be 	possible to use extra disks ? 	Thanks in advance.

>I heard the rumor as well, but the story differed.  Intel was not coming  >out with the tripling clock 486, a clone from IBM was. No rumour, IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last fall (COMDEX or something, I wasn't there). All you people who are drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like 486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real estate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its 486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become available in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other companies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will). -- Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software
Greetings!     I've had a bunch of problems with the 24x.  Opening a DOS window on the desktop can occasionally result in the windows "blowing up" into a set of horizontal lines, hashing the entire desktop.  Nothing can recover this  except to completely exit from Windows.  The other irritating problem is that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually scrolling, as if a CR was printed without an LF.  This seems ONLY to happen to communications programs, but I can't nail it down any further than that. Note, though, that the comms programs don't have to be communicating.  Even just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in these programs causes the problem.        Prior to the latest rev of Word Perfect for Windows, WPwin would sometimes blow up, and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of the problem.  I've still seen this, but only once or twice with WPwin 5.2.        Dave Zimmerman    (My opinions are my own)

However, the best source of general information on  building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled  separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your  sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at  the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the  xstuff mail server. 	In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration includes information on configuring and building X. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07  may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with  libdl.a.  Add "-ldl" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to  surround it with "-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES variable, since "syslibs" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual  compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile  the stubs shared.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be undefined when building some X11 clients:  	_get_wmShellWidgetClass 	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" appears to work.  To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please  contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: Patch i.d.      Description 100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using                         shared libXmu A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad  get around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93] 	contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X. 	Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms. 	Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when  gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or  return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and  the server. 	This is from the GCC manual: 	On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for  	structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument 	list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by  	reference. 	This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet 	supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it. 	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and 	`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help. You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.   	Files which need to be compiled using cc include: 		server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c  		rgb/rgb.c 	In addition, several of the "inet_" functions use structs as args or return values:   		clients/xhost/xhost.c  		clients/xauth/gethost.c.  Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly  harmless as they don't involve structs. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error  	"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket.  	Fatal server bug! no screens found." 	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do  this simple test: 	#include <sys/ioctl.h> 	SIOCGIFCONF Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of  interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your  fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are  identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found "missing" defines for  CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be? 	The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:         #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)         #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN 	However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so  references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the  Imakefile.  [11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found. 	Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include  from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line  	#define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied  from another distribution. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- All of the executables that I try to run have the following results: 	ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even: 	ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c 	If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you  need to run "ldconfig" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium] 	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).   A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using  shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these: 	1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site. 	2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic). 	3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries. The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display. Check the man page for fbtab(5). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles  suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable. 	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious. 	There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different. 	You can obtain information on imake from these sources: 	- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X 	- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information 	- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake. 	- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and  config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby.  [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert. 	- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article "Das Meta-Make  / I make, you make / Schwerelos" by Rainer Klute in "iX  Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin", directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1. 	- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake. 	- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in  sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z. [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier  version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such  configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the  templates distributed with X11R5. 	export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution. 	A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run "xmkmf". This is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a  Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make,  which will use that new Makefile to compile the program. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error: 	Undefined: 	_XShapeQueryExtension 	_XShapeCombineMask 	These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway. 	In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error "ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit". 	What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called. 	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.  	1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in. 	2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.  	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem. 	 11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this message: 	Undefined: 	_XtScrollBarSetThumb 	_XtTextSetInsertionPoint 	_XtTextReplace 	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called "hints" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:         XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints) If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'. Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.  	If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant. [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.  	For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to "test just  this one little thing" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib "Hello World" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90] 	In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this: 	{ 	Arg args[3]; 	int i; 	int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */ 	i=0; 	XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++; 	XtGetValues(widget, args, i ); 	... 	} But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable "sensitive" as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent. 	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets' data becoming corrupted. 	[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the "new" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget. 	Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 		"Just the FAQs, ma'am." -- Joe Friday  --  David B.

Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5 	The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation 	system) did work in R4, but refused to in R5. Of cause, the R4-version 	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition). 	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error 	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the 	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText  	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero.  	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not). 	 			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what 			to do about?

>What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost? Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with 5MB/s and Hard drives START at 160MB I have NO idea. For the Mac I have the following {These are ALL external}  20MB $299 {$15/MB}  52MB $379 {$7.3/MB}  80MB $449 {$5.63/MB} 120MB $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/MB 210MB $979-$1029{$4.67-$4.90/MB} 320MB $1499-$1549 {$4.68-$4.84/MB} 510MB $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/MB} etc So scsi-1/SCSI-2 for the Mac goes down in price/MB as hard drive size goes up {and I assume the same for the PC world.} >I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented >data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better >(than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when >managing data from a single SCSI hard drive. Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface.  In the Mac {since SCSI is THE inteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used for the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross drive interfacing as fast as the OS, program, CPU, SCSI, and drive can handle  it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}. In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well. Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards  {this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'}, CD-ROM, etc. IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any and I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface {Make of that what you will} SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE. This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water. Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago {When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played and SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI off into the statosphere price wise} SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the standard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it choose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces {at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}

(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered) Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles "regular" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a "proper" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped. The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow "tickle" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item. What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server,   you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM).   xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly   available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.   A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared   memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT   server.

Hi everyone. I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my new LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may be a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So I'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure out what type of chip MacConnection sent me. Each chip says: M518121A-80J 		 2515251 On the back of the card, it says 0593 I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figure out what the size is supposed to be. If anyone can help, I'd be grateful. Please email me your response. Thanks a lot! --  "Is rot13 rotated 13 forward or backward?" 	--Anonymous

	Hi everyone, 	I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming  in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep  getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the  program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so  I can't seem to explain why it crashes. All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.   Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything?? 	I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup, I will gladly re-post, but this is the only I could find. Thanks in advance, Sean Mars Carroll College  Waukesha, WI
Can someone point me in the direction of any papers (not necessarily formally conducted studies) discussing how much traffic X apps generate for the network, particularly in comparison with curses-bases apps  over telnet?  Also, does an X server typically buffer up user keyboard input a line at a time?  Can the X client control this, asking for keystrokes immediately?

Hai, In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses). It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard. It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is. I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around. My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things: 	- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2 	  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example) 	- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it 	  support (text & graphics) 	- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM 	- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000 	- Support in software If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell me about it. For the people in Holland: Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam!
Hi 	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say "Buy the memory from us" or something like that.) 	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why, and all I got was "Your point is well taken, but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects." 	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken. 	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are "less busy".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?), although evenn that might be a misprint. 	Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL. Thanks.

X Window installation on a Sun4/470 with CG6 alone and with CG2 as screen:0.0 and CG6 as screen:0.1. Questions: 1)  Are there any hardware configuration changes on the CG2 and/or CG6 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the CG2 frame buffer in the vme bus? 2)  The CG6 is called a 'graphics accelerator' as apposed to a 'frame buffer'. What is the significance of this to the X server and how do we install the SunOS driver / X to be compatable. ----------------------- I would appreciate any information on this.

I have an external hard drive I wish to use as startup disk. problem is, when I switch on the mac, it boots on the internal HD, but when I restart  (warm boot) the mac, it boots from the external. how do I make  it boot directly from the external ? please email replies if possible. thanks in advance. jerry
I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor video card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am running Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping the program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first, very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application. The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of? Thanks.
Has anyone connected a high-res, fixed frequency monitor to their PC? I have a mitubishi monitor that does 1024x768 at 60hz, but won't do any other resolutions.  All the video cards designed for this sort of thing are very expensive (>$400).  Has anyone done it with an SVGA card (I know it can be done, it's just a question of getting the card at the right resolution and frequency)?  I'd like to use a mono (hercules) monitor as my dos/command line monitor, and switch to the mitsu for Windows or X-windows (under Linux or 3BSD). Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group, just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new). Every new chip set confuses them. >The supported resolutions really annoy me.

Higher vertical resolution >was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, >and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well. I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy, you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick, too.) >The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules >Speedy program.

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from "unbiased" sources, such as testing labs, columnists, etc. >Interestingly, the solid >vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, >filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.

I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and the results of anything else in the universe on these things. >I give two >numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching. >When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- >1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds >like programming to a benchmark to me.... Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the "Bart Simpson optimization," in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.  (We call it the "Bart Simpson optimization" because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he could right "I will not cheat on benchmarks" a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.) >I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.

Hi,     I have a piece of X code that compiles fine on pmax-ul4, pmax_mach, as well as sun4_mach, but whenever it compiles on sun4_411, it gives me  undefined ld errors: _sin _cos _pow _floor _get_wmShellWidgetClass _get_applicationShellWidgetClass The following libraries that I linked it to are: -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 The makefile is generated off an imake template. Can anyone give me pointers as to what I'm missing out to compile on a sun4_411? Thanx Wilson

You'll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different mappings, so don't expect them to always sound correct without using some kind of midi file editor, such as Voyetra's Sequencer Plus. You can attempt to use the midi-mapper to remap the patches for soundblaster, but since you cannot modify the sbfm.drv you are allways stuck with the instruments that come with this driver.  Unless you can find an editor for making modifications to the instrument settings in sbfm.drv , I would suggest you locate the early version of soundblaster drivers that were mapped to mt32 voices, and the later drivers that are mapped to the general midi voices.    :    : --  :    of New York   / "If music be the food of love, \  | | ()|||||||[:::}
Greetings. I am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively create/edit/view a visual "model" (i.e. topology) of their network, and I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to simplify this task. In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM/X product to develop other GUIs, so I am familiar with UIMSs in general. The topology will support objects and connecting links.  Once the topology is created, I want to provide the user with capabilities to support grouping, zooming, etc. I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing routines to accomplish this.  Specifically, the zooming and grouping aspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming,  if I have to "roll my own". Suggestions? -greg
Subject: [REQUEST] Need tvtwm sources with mods from R. J.

I still have the patches, however, I can no longer find the sources to which they applied ;-).  	I'd appreciate if some kind soul could send me a pointer to where I could find the sources. Has anyone updated the patches for R5? (Richard? are you out there? pretty please?) 	Thanks in advance. 		manoj

I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now.  I must say this machine is really fast!  The hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but I got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm. However, I still have a few complaints: - when I restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop   pattern) jerks up and down for a few times. - the Quantum 170 drive is noisy Overall, I highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great! -- Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada

I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any real reviews of them. One of the cards the local stores are pushing is the Genoa 8500 for $125-140. Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc. chip, but I don't know which one (GD5426?). One of the shops I've spoken with  claims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (S3 86C805 based), but that can't be true if it is using the GD5426. I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it lags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one  of them. Any info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. If I get replies via email, I'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested. Thanks in advance,

Keywords:  Xt Intrisics Programming Manual, chapter 3. popup dialog boxes and so on. In example 3.5, page 76 : "Creating a pop-up dialog box" The application creates window with a button "Quit" and "Press me". The button "Press me" pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time),  it is *much* slower. Has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why I get this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response time from 2nd time onwards ? Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time they popup in reasonable fast response time ? Thankyou - Shirley

The JP5 on the Speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems. If your system fails to boot-up proprtly, please pull off the jumper block from jp5.

These questions can be answered by any dealer of IBM Value Points, but, I will provide some unsolicited advice -- the most amusing kind of advice. Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board. Do not buy a 486SX sytem. My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models. Gordon

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution. 	In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 	It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a "yes" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:  	void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call) 	{ 		int             answer; 		answer = AskUser(w, "Really Quit?"); 		if (RET_YES == answer) 			{ 			answer = AskUser(w, "Are You Really Positive?"); 			if (RET_YES == answer) 				exit(0);                 } 	} 	A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it. 	This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the  Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of  dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for "OK", "Cancel" and  "Help" or equivalents:   int AskUser(w, string)         Widget          w;         char           *string;   {         int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */         Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/         Arg             args[3];         int             n = 0;         XtAppContext    context;         n=0;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                 XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;         dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);         XtManageChild(dialog);         context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);         while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                 XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);         }         XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */         return answer;   } 	The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same  function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user  finally selects one of those choices:   void response(w, client, call)         Widget          w;         XtPointer client;         XtPointer call;   {   int *answer = (int *) client;   XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;         switch (reason->reason) {         case XmCR_OK:                 *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */                 break;         case XmCR_CANCEL:                 *answer = RET_NO;  		break;         case XmCR_HELP:                 *answer = RET_HELP;                 break;         default:                 return;         } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there. WidgetWrap library. 2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is. 	Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which  will work on both widgets and non-widget objects. 	If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do  what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures  and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4. 	#include <X11/CoreP.h> 	#include <X11/Xresource.h> 	String XtName (widget) 	Widget widget;	/* WILL work with non-widget objects */ 	{ 	return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name); 	} ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program: > canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */ > ... > window = XtWindow(canvas);	/* get the window associated with the widget */ > ... > XDrawLine (...,window,...);	/* produces error */ 	The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the  realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL ("no window") could  create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget()  before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.  	Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call,  but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also  wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of  the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error: 1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and  the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server: 	 	display = XOpenDisplay(display_name); 	if (display) 		{ do X stuff } 	else 		{ do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case  XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set]. This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line  argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is  adequate. [5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application? 	The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is  as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel  window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other  application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the  user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual  desktop.) Substitute "toplevel" with your top-most widget here (similar code  should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):      unsigned long valuemask;      XSetWindowAttributes attributes;      /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */      valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;      attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);      attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);      /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by         its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */      XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,          65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,          CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes); where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767. When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well. In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor  resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which  continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its  children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X  connection to the display.  	What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,  		close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your  exec. You will then be able to exit the parent. 	Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file  descriptor to be closed on exec. 		(void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1); ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical  sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which  might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  Xlib or Xt functions. 	You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added. Volume 6 are in error. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error  handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or  Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or  the other file descriptor. 	A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt  callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers. 	Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. 	Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always  ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data: 	     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a  busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event. 	 If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use  XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server. 	Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- > ... > the_window = XCreateSimpleWindow(the_display, >      root_window,size_hints.x,size_hints.y, >      size_hints.width,size_hints.height,BORDER_WIDTH, >      BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen), >      WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen)); > ... > XSelectInput(the_display,the_window,ExposureMask|ButtonPressMask| > 	ButtonReleaseMask); > XMapWindow(the_display,the_window); > ... > XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100); > ... 	You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the  window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will  generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code  would appear after window was created and mapped:   while (!done)     {       XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);       switch (the_event.type) { 	case Expose:	 /* On expose events, redraw */ 		XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100); 		break; 	... 	}     } 	Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't  set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background  colors, so this program could previously include this code:   ...   the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */   the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */   the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                 GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);   ...   black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1  and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be  reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all. Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong  thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for  foreground and background. And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A  server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  Screens on this particular Display connection. 	The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number. 	In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine  the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen. 	(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have "Display" in the names --  XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.) 	 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 	The X11R4/5 header files are compatible with C++.

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The  window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're  sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea()  to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read  back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD  and Stuart Marks of Sun] 	Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a  (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the  original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.  [courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 	A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices: 	- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers  support the extension. 	- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note  that there is no X notion of a "transparent color index". 	- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. 	- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly. The X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this last option] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] 	If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. 	If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics  context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.  This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and  blue. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue  fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is  full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)  the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the  standard colormap, but it doesn't work.  	XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does  not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there  -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a  mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it. 	Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow  errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its ID reallocated to another window. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that  knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared]. 	The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple  applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to  create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.] 	Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level  cooperation among your applications.  	Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return  the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;   __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, "__SWM_VROOT", False);   XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);   for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) { 	Atom            actual_type; 	int             actual_format; 	long            nitems, bytesafter; 	Window         *newRoot = NULL; 	if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1, 	    False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,             &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) { 			root = *newRoot; 			break; 		} 	} 	return root; } version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91] A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h  functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop. 	 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.  [1/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped --  imagine the conflict between two such programs running.   	The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup  menus or other short parameter-setting windows). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of double-clicking. 	There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do  client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you  have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish  implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of  the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that. 	Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 	Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. 	Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it "by  hand" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via  XPutImage(); more specifically: 	1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it. 	2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage). 	3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation. 	4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where  		a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) 		b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 	5) render I2 	Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. 	The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X  also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. 	In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph. 	InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for rendering rotated fonts in X.  It could be one source of example code. 	Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are  stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine  (posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing  the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font. set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle.  Version 3.0  was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also  on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z.  	O'Reilly's X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things. 	The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types, application classes, and class extension record types; and several others. 	The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5  tape; it is also available by sending "send docs registry" to the xstuff mail server. 	To register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send  confirmation.

Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics. And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed. The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well. >because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big. I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G. 						Yousuf Khan

G'day All, I was looking to build a Parallel Port Digital to Analogue Converter the other day and came across this schematic which I promptly threw together on a piece of VeroBoard:      P2----22k----+      P3----48k----|      P4----100k---|      P5----200k---|      P6----400k---|      P7----800k---|    10uf electrolytic      P8----1M6----|  +      P9----3M2----+---||--+----------                           |            +             47nF ceramic  -                              -                           |            -      P25------------------+---------- (Please excuse the obvious limits of the Lower ASCII char set :=) I have it all constructed here and sitting inside a nice little grey ABS box. Unfortunately I can't get it to work... I have a little demo here by the name of Cronologia (Which the schematic came from) and all I can get it to pump out of the box is data type hash/static with a small amount of music signal behind it - it's even worse than the speaker inside the machine. Does anybody out in net.colourful.computer.world have any ideas/suggestions/ better designs/improvements/wastepaper bin... etc? Many thanks for a reply via this conference or email.   // \X/  Regards, Jason. --- +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Jason Bordujenko                                    Computer Department | | FidoNet Node   : 3:640/702 (Grammar BBS)               45 Paxton Street | | Data Phone No. : +61 77 72 6052 (Int.)

Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines, and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0, and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) --  "I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class." -Unknown
Thanks to all who responded to my original post.  I got the number for Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the BIOS to the Super BIOS.  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/ write heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  The upgrade is $15, payable by check or money order.  Send to: 	Western Digital Corporation 	Technical Support Group 	P.O. Box 19665 	Irvine, CA  92713-9665 The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the WD1002 series. The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives. Keith -- _____________________________ __-----____--___--__-----____	D.

C. >As I said above, the drive is a Seagate ST-251. >The system is a Compaq Portable (circa 1985).      Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this older stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)      First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.       Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read  either :     62-000042-015 or              62-000094-0x2      If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems. > >Controller jumpers are set as follows: ("-" represents jumper) >	W1	1-2 3 >       W2      1-2 3 >	W3	1-2 >	W4	1 2-3 >	W5	1 2 3 >	W6	1-2 3 >	W7	1 2 3     Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address. >The drive jumpers are as follows: ("8" represents jumper)     Looks right.    [art deleted] >Here are my questions: > >1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?       I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:               5 + +    open               6 + +    open                            7 + +    open                       8 + +    open               4 + +    closed               3 + +    closed               2 + +    open               1 + +    open Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1).          If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here. >2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?       See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.         The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day..... >3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?      Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:                 -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)         This will return the rom date, if it's of any use. >Keith Rice       If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).                      -->   Bob Valentine  <--   	id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500 	id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT If you are using a TWISTED 34-way cable then move the jumper  on your drive to the neighbouring pins   :8::::::.  Make sure that the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy disk) - the coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist. This may also help.

NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS            contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.             When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will            not "boot."  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips            must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital             XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3            or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT            controller you are using).                                                   -2-                      NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1,            WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in            Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or            "A" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)            instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or            the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the            etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then            solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the            modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1            (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION            TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY            ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the            WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must            be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the            interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

You can But a disk compare utility (old versus new) will.  And Windows 3.1 is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs. >write over the "Licensed to:", but you can't change the name underneth it.  I >think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate, and we're not >going to promote that here. No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like* dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another. So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information: 1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\WINSTALL myself. 2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\WINORIG. 3.  Install from c:\winstall. 4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \winorig\*.* >\report.txt 5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one. 6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with "real pirates" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that). As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.

I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (Then again I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears for the second time: Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry  option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now is: How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour. Thanks for any hints ---> Robert PS: I'm working in plain X, using tvtwm. ****************************************************************************** * Robert Gasch        * Der erste Mai ist der Tag an dem die Stadt ins      * * Oracle Engineering   * Freihe tritt und den staatlichen Monopolanspruch    * * De Meern, NL        * auf Gewalt in Frage stellt                          * ****************************************************************************** ----------------------- Headers ------------------------ >From uupsi7!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xpert-mailer Thu Apr 22 17:24:28 1993 remote from aolsys         id AA02784 for ; Thu, 22 Apr 93 12:04:36 -0400  id AA17104; Thu, 22 Apr 93 10:19:31 EDT

One solution, sometimes, is to disable "blind writes" This doesn't sound right to me.  Don't Quadras use the 53C96?  If so, the Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  That's all handled by the chip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager. Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra. On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.  On the 5396, the handshake is entirely handled by the chip. --Tim Smith
I'm thinking about upgrading my 030 50MHz to the 040 33version.  Has anyone had any experience with the accelerator, and if so - what do you think? Any problems, what are the speedometer results?, is it much faster than the 50MHz?  Basically, I'd appreciate hearing all about this product.

Greetings, I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals: PseudoColor 8 bit, Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit. A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow, something like: "In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used  in the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs." This warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides. However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. The code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ---------------- Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height) Display *dpy; int width, height; {   Window win;   XVisualInfo vinfo;   XSetWindowAttributes attr;   fprintf(stderr,"Opening 8 bit window...\n");   if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpy,DefaultScreen(dpy),8,PseudoColor,&vinfo)) {     fprintf(stderr,"Your display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n");     exit(1);   }   fprintf(stderr,"Using visual: %x\n",vinfo.visual->visualid);   cmap = XCreateColormap(            dpy,            DefaultRootWindow(dpy),            vinfo.visual,            AllocNone          );   XSync(dpy,False);   XInstallColormap(dpy,cmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */   attr.colormap = cmap;   win = XCreateWindow(           dpy,           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),           10,10,           width,height,           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */           8,                    /* depth */           InputOutput,          /* class */           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */           CWColormap,           &attr         );   return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----- Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

Hey folks. Is it possible to short out your CMOS chip?  I think mine is fried. These are the symptoms... I have to do the following to get my computer (a Gateway 486DX33) to boot...     Turn the power off     Disconnect the battery to the CMOS chip     Turn the power on     Get into setup upon getting the CMOS configuration error     Set up the CMOS     Exit the setup with [F10]  (phoenix bios)     Ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [F1] The computer then boots normally.  Both hard drives are accessible but the floppy drives are not. I can back up over the network and such, but if I need to reboot, I have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.  If I simply <Ctl>-<Alt>-<Del>, the computer hangs after the memory test. Does this sound like the CMOS chip is fried?  Can I buy another one? Where? Thank you for your kind attention. john --

That isn't enough to change your Windows startup logo.  vgalogo.rle is not  needed after you have installed Windows.  It is incorporated as a part of  win.com. 	To make a new win.com, you have to concatinate three files together,  using the /b option for a binary concatonation.  I beleive it is copy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle mywin.com Make sure you backup your win.com file in anotehr directory before you do this  -- I absent-mindedly typed win.com instead of mywin.com and had to resinstall  Windows! 	Anyway, substitute whatever .RLE file you want.  The win.cnf has the  info needed to start Windows (think of it as a bootstrap) and vgalogo.vga has  video information.  Just make sure that the .RLE file doesn't tip the whole  COM file size over the 64k limit of a .COM file! 	So anyway, I use mywin.com to startup MS Windows.

Hi,     I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B, and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.

I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE drive.

Hi all, I have a DLL in which I Register a class and create a window of that class type.  Both calls require a module instance handle, hInstance. Petzold's 3.1 book says that it is best to use the module instance handle of the calling program, not the module instance handle of the DLL (page 934). I have two questions: 1)  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module? 2)  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of     the DLL?

Hello Netlanders:        I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod.        My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows:        486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4         Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive.        I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and        inet utilities (tcp/ip).        I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.    I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems.  However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the  machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the  tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to  startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background  pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login  from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.  I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4  server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also   claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't  need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get  XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet  packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.  I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same  system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.    One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true,  what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?  Thanks,    AT&T Bell Laboratories  263 Shuman Blvd.  Naperville, IL  60566

Hello,    When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying "cannot load app-defaults file..." check your XAPPLRESDIR environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory  ( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable.    If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly.    To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or  /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is set up.    Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX.  For example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system directory resource should be set like this : *systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory     Thanks,       ICS Tech Support
I just purchased The Norton Desktop for windows, and I also have Norton Utilities.  When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?        I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I        erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected. From the experiments I have run, The two programs (Erase Protect and smart Erase) don't use each others info. I currently have both EP and smartcan loading within my autoexec, and I don't see any conflicts; FYI :  Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.2        Norton Util's version 6 Thanks for any help.

>I am looking for one of those color LCD screens you >place on an overhead projector and control the presentation >with a Mac. >Can you recommend me a particular brand? >What price are we talking about? For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very* bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e. stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do with tarrifs being lifted I think).  In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about $5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam projector, but sacrifice portability. Oh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that light wash out your display at the front of the room. Tricky to get right.

I thought SCSI was good at >managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached.  If we are >only talking about a single drive, explain why SCSI is inherently >faster at managing data from a hard drive. You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some   specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller   specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a  SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2  which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it   needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be   very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst   {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and  reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between  SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports. IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max. So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost} SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while IDE itself limits the through put.

I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000. 	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type : 	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget) but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests.  For example: 	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args) Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h, or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions. 	Many thanks in advance for any help. -- <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> Graphics Group       | 512-838-2834 I am the terror that flaps in the night.
Hi there! What is your recommendation for a good hard-disk driver software for non-Apple drives? I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media drive, but maybe for some normal drives too. I have heard and seen good things about SilverLining, but don't know any competitors. It does not need to be fancy, filled with features... I more like it affordable. Thanks -- Jartsu

Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office. Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on my Sparc and PC with only one hitch.  The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory.  On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows installation. The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory had the line DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console. By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at `hostname`:1.0 Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line. My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB Bitmap Stuff Sucked. Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable. Xmail was very usable. At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was a very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged "WINDOWS should not be called a SCHEDULER", besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while. Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales person said they performed about the same, given the over head of WINDOWS I question this? many thanks for help to all who responded gerard
     I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to  override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am  using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be  working with Open Look in the future.      What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the  user from switching from one window of the application to  another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top  of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks  the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the  window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain  circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to  beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window  A.       From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that  this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this  case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default  processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell  when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping  notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the  switch.       The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very  kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch  in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force  the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call  and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary  functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places  twice.       Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any*  window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to  actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this  newsgroup.

This is crazy!  I have  >never had so much trouble with a mouse before.  Anyone have any solutions?   Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see (probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful* You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt. Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.   I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom is that when you move the mouse, it seems to "click" along.  If this doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak, place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep the dust off. Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point: if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is  streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice that it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps. --   Peter Goudswaard                  _________                     _________                                   |         |   >           <   |         |  "There's no gift like the present"         |    >_________<    |         |     - Goudswaard's observation    |_________|         |         |_________|
>If such a device exists, are there are any limits to the number of >serial devices I can use? How many NuBus slots do you have? Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they think they open a built-in port. They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance) and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles 8 ports simultaneously. As I said, with NuBus, you're green.

*Reminder*   Plan now for the Andrew Conference. *Date* The dates are as noted below.  (We have not changed them.) *Submission extension*   We are still accepting papers. *Tutorial topic*   	_Converting Andrew source code to C++_ This tutorial will discuss the steps necessary to convert a site from C (extended with classC) to C++.  Conversion of the source code requires only a couple of steps: 	run the converter 	fill in missing type information Describing this will not take long.  The remainder of the day will be spent learning how to write objects in C++ and practicing. ------------------------------ 1993 Andrew Technical Conference and Consortium Annual Meeting June 24-25, 1993 Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA The conference will be held on the last Thursday and Friday in June.  A tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the 25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting, though only Consortium members will be able to vote. This year's theme is  	Application Construction by Non-Programmers Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as 	What is needed for application construction by non-programmers? 	Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed? 	Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to create new widgets? 	Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves? Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including 	applications 	experience with users 	new objects 	reviews of and proposals for revision of  		internal Andrew protocols We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration.   Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993. Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June. Fred Hansen Director, Andrew Consortium
 |Hi, everybody:  |    I guess my subject has said it all.  It is getting boring  |looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows.  So,  |I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file  |I can share.  Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for  |some bmp files, like some scenery files, some animals files,  |etc....  I used to have some, unfortunately i delete them all.  |  |Anyway could me give me some help, please???  | 	In response to a "different" kinda wallpaper, here's what I use.  I think the original gif/whatever was called "not_real".  The  artist name and logo is in the lower right corner.  You will need VGA I think, and I have this sized for 800x600 256 color screens.

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment came from a simple "open-draw-quit" client.   As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and then call the "window_redraw()" (or whatever) directly?  Although, depending on how the overall application is structured, there may be no problem with rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

I just bought an actix graphics engine 32 plus with 2 megs.   I am not impressed... I have been having all sorts of problems with the board.  Various lock-ups in windows, problems with the screen not centering, no flexibilty in choosing synch rates for a monitor, buggy windows drivers, lack of 1024x768x64k driver, If anyone else has one of these cards, please e-mail me... Looks like i'm going to try the ati ultra plus... --  ****************************************************************************

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months. The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections. Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup. Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.  In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends. Let me know if you have any more questions. Peter Hansen Bell Northern Research

"return_place" is probably incorrect.  It should be a pointer, not an integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory, copies the data there, and returns a pointer to the memory.  You should free the memory when you're done. ---

We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms.  For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has    always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a       filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                         Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as    a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together    at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying   to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will   allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                             I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC  product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).                                        I have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so I assume that ours is not a new problem.  Who has had to deal with it ?  What solutions have   you come up with?                                                                thanks in advance for any and all suggestions via posting or EMAIL.

According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus. Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems). First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system. If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this  fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement. Hope this helps.   --  David C.

Hi all, has anybody tried to compile CTRLTEST from the MFC/SAMPLES directory, after compiling the MFC-libs with BWC ? Seems to me, that BWC isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded functions. For example, imagine the following 2 (overloaded) functions: void same_name ( void )  void same_name ( int )   After trying the whole day, I think, with BWC its impossible to take the adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined function pointer.  Am I right ? Has anybody else had this problem ? 	thanx

I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions.  Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have three transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month, middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps. Mike

You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)    As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be modified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't tried this, but that would be my guess... 				Robert Anisko ...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper to go that route than to do the conversion; besides, with the Falcon and beyond, VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go...

Hi, I just got a problem, I have a cheapo 2400bps modem which I use to connect to my university, but I get too much garbage on the screen. I do know it's because the noise in the line (I can actually hear it).

	I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print  some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are using an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu. You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems that SE ROMs won't support those "features". Okay, I  guess I should have somehow known that this was the case. Let the buyer beware, huh Apple? 	Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the  problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the  ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living (on unix platforms) and I don't understand the "it just can't be done" responses I've gotten from those I have asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft- ware, just such a fix.  	Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could someone armed with enough info and a little pro- gramming experience cook something up that would supplement the ROM's capabilities? 	Also, how does one know if one's mac can support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300 is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer and trying it out like I did) 	Thanks for your help.   Bill Wright

With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.

My  understanding is that the "optional fpu" refers to your option of purchasing the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU. Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system (a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor. Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU - the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).

Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs.  Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct?

I have the following problem on X11R5 servers. When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored. Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window, no expose event is sent. When ExposureMask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws. Everything works fine with X11R4. Is this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)? Is it something I do wrong?

Organization: /users/student/coe/.organization I currently use a window manager called ctwm which is very similar to hp's vuewm. (i.e.  it has multiple workspaces).

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed. Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:    /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */    palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;    palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;    palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;    XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);    XFlush( myDisplay);    XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);    XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex); Then to draw I do:    XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);    XFlush( myDisplay); And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:    XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy); What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image). Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong? david
I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM drives for my c650, but my local Apple doesn't know  when they will be available.  He doesn't even have a part number yet.   Does anyone know what the part number  for this drive is and when it will be available? My Apple dealer suggested I buy one of the CD300 external drives, but I don't want to pay extra for a case/power supply I'm not going to use. -Rodney Jacks

You get away with it because CopyFromParent is #define'ed to be zero in X.h. If it happened to be defined as -1 you'd get a very interesting looking window!  	Du Pont Pixel Systems Ltd.

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets, perhaps even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets back into my long pulldown menus?

Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the  Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers: (1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000  running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a  lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors  that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors  sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell  memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most  memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether  the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine  California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB -  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that  are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an  average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a  backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move  your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or  non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read. Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay  for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to  sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about  $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for  about $900.  The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much. I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got  one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright -- theporch.raider.net  615/297-7951 The MacInteresteds of Nashville

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper. : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down : in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc : or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions : of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to : come down in price. No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice. : I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive. On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE: A (partial?) list: 	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them  	concurrently. 	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac 	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice 	with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go) 	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For 	instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor 	212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will 	work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the 	termination, plug it in, and away it goes. 	4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that 	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is 	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c: 	to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very 	noticable, as many things can be going on at once. One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.   Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

Hi all: Thanks to you all who have responded to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem. I'd like to ask a few more questions. 1.  What are the advantages of buying a global village Teleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra, Zoom etc? 2.  I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software. Why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems of Supra?  What kind of incompatibility is it? 3.  If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold, is there any possibility to add a voice option in the near future? 4.  Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer this coming summer? 5.  A person did mention a new AT&T modem.  Is it getting good reviews from various Mac Magazines? 6.  If I want the best, fastest, most economically sound and possible voice option, what fax modem should I buy? Sorry for posting so many questions, but I think they're necessary. I promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder. Thanks so much in advance. Regards, Thian.
I would like advice on how to configure my 486 to accept: - Com1 + Com2  (currently on IRQ 4 and 3) - LPT1 (IRQ7) - Bus Mouse (IRQ5) - Sound Card (no idea what to do - can be set to any) -  using IRQ2 for Bus MOuse gobbled up too many cycles, and caused loss of communications with floppy disks, and a few other  problems. I could, I suppose, switch the 2 com devices externally, and disable the second port on the Super IO card, but I really want to  have them both available. COuld the sound card use IRQ2 without horsing up the works? All replies apppreciated - and I only just subscribed to this newsgroup - I assume there is an FAQ somewhere (rather, I'm sure someone will tell me about it....) thanks Mark Fraser

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added. This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x. Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies. Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT: HISTORY The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation, has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell. I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell  bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC). NEW RELEASE I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings.  This release offers: - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset  - Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate   progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake 		     and its config files on your site. I have tried to 		     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable 		     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely 		     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you 		     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma 		     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude 		     of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted   on Usenet. WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS Ftp: Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11. Note: Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours. Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings. E-mail: Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by e-mail. REQUEST Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-).  MORE INFORMATION  If you are desperate, then you can call me at +31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands call 030-506711). Enjoy! --  Ronald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference  3DCV Group, Utrecht |    The Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.

It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X, due out last February :-) has full support for C++. I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages of these other tools but does fully support C++ code generation, reusable templates via C++ classes which are generated, a variety of other handy features for using C++ and layout functions in different ways, and generates Motif 1.2 code (including drag 'n drop,  internationalization, etc.).  Fits in quite nicely with Doug Young's paradigm for C++/Motif. Available in the US from VI Corp, in Europe from Imperial Software, London (see FAQ for details).

In comp.os.ms-windows.misc you write: >While reading through the DOS 6.0 book, it states that the Windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive.  To make things compatable, >I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the upgrade.  However, when all the dust settled, and I go into windows, it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was, in the Windows directory.  My question is:  How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive, and the permanent one doesn't? you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one, but here is my best explanation.  But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base... The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that). Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file. compressed disks are actually "logical" disks.  These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this "inbetween" program, windows cannot use direct methods to read from the "logical" disk. a permenant swap file is only there to "reserve" an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows.) a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER) more on permenent swap files... i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message "you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this swap file anyway" or something like that. well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why. what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers. They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he  said! available to me if it's not going to use it? any takers? James (if this doesn't get to the net, will someone post it for me?  thanks)
A silly question: I frequently edit small files and need to make copies of them on several floppy diskettes of the same size and format, but my computer is only equipped with one 3.5" HD drive and one 5.25" HD drive; can't I do the copying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk (which is 99.9% full) using standard MSDOS 5.0 commands? I know diskcopy a: a: works but for small selections of files, xcopy a:*.txt a: does not! Maybe I'll have to write my own file copy command in C, but the idea does not amuse me. Thanks for your help.

I am new to X programming, so please bear with me.... I am trying to have a dialog box that returns it's value upon the user entering a new value and hitting the <return> key. (don't want to have a "done" button).  The piece of code below will work if I exclude the XtNvalue argument but will not work as is. Can someone shed some light on this or suggest a better way?  Ultimately I will have several areas active at the same time to allow a user to modify parameters in the program.   Thanks for your help, Karen Rogers Dupont ######### Code starts here ################ void doit() { printf("Entered the doit function\n"); exit(); } main(argc, argv) int argc; char **argv; { Widget toplevel; Widget outer; XtAppContext app_con; Widget samples; Arg args[3]; static XtActionsRec key_actions[]=      {     {"doit", doit},     }; toplevel = XtVaAppInitialize(&app_con, "TEST", NULL, 0, 	                       &argc, argv, NULL, NULL); outer = XtCreateManagedWidget( "paned", panedWidgetClass, toplevel, 					NULL, ZERO); XtAppAddActions(app_con, key_actions, XtNumber(key_actions)); XtSetArg(args[0], XtNlabel, "Enter value"); XtSetArg(args[1], XtNvalue, "0"); samples = XtCreateManagedWidget("samples", dialogWidgetClass,outer,args,2); XtOverrideTranslations(samples,      XtRealizeWidget(toplevel); XtAppMainLoop(app_con); }

Hi, I would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on IDE Controllers. I would liek to get a IDE controller card for my VLB DX2 66 Motherboard. What are good options for this (preferably under $200). It MUST also work under OS/2 and be compatible with Stacker (and other Disk Compression S/W). Please advise .....

How can one tell which prong of your basic chip is number 20?  I realize there is a chunk of the chip missing so that one can orient it correctly.  So  using that hole as a guide, how can I count the prongs of the chip to find #20?

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was able to help me. The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls: main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 main_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,                 main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win); The event mask for main_win is:         PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |         EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask; The flags are         PPosition | PSize I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values): detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,                 detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.   If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some detail I'm overseeing. Thanks for any tips ---> Robert PS: The same message was accidentally appended to the "Expose Events" thread. Sorry for any confusion caused.
		    Configuration of IDE Harddisks 		    ============================== last update:	14.4.1993 and published regularly on comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order to update the list. If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list! Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for. If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set 65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it). Another statement (maybe right): IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark. The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed. ***************************   C O N N E R   *************************** 		Conner Peripherals Drive Geometry IDE/AT Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector. LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms. LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave. LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way. LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.    There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:      Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.    The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.    The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further details. ***************************   S E A G A T E   ************************* There is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on every Simtel mirror under /msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip It contains info about the following drives: 	    st1144a	st138a	    st274a	st3283a st1057a     st1156a	st1400a     st280a	st351ax st1090a     st1162a	st1401a     st3051a	st9051a st1102a     st1186a	st1480a     st3096a	st9077a st1111a     st1201a	st157a	    st3120a	st9096a st1126a     st1239a	st2274a     st3144a	st9144a st1133a     st125a	st2383a     st325ax *********************	T E A C   **************                 Cyls.

I have been experiencing several end-user problems with various commercial software packages (WordPerfect 5.2/WIN, Publish It!/WIN 3.1) and printing landscape mode on a Citizen PN48 (the little guy) or the Citizen GSX-140+. In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0.625 inches of information from my left margin, be it white space or TrueType font output, and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the first. WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the "Default" location for the printers instead of "Tractor" or "Manual".  They have also filed this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it. MS Write, of course, has no problem with these printer drivers, proving that Microsoft knows something the rest of us don't!  Are you surprised?  I'm not. Publish It!/WIN is still investigating this problem, and while I was consider- my options (rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package, for *surely* they wouldn't have this problem, right?) I stumbled onto a global workaround. WORKAROUND ---------- Go into the Windows 3.1 control panel, select printers, select your Citizen printer driver, select SETUP, and select a custom size of 850 x 1132.  Like magic, all of your problems will go away. Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies! -- Mike ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ======================================================================== ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ========================================================================

In other words, I want $HOST and $LOGNAME to appear   > as a title of opened XTerm and $HOST when XTerm is closed.   > How can I do it? [Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ. Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't seen the FAQ lately to check.] Two ways:    1) When you start the xterm, you can use command line options:          -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label          -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title          -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE  2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:     The basic escape sequence is: 	ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL     where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters,     <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending     on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,     or both, and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string.     Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:          echo "\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"      To set just the icon title:          echo "\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"      To set just the window title:          echo "\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"      Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,     depending on how the echo command works on your system     and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics     under Bourne or Korn shells).     [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of     /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have     to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string     instead of using convenient octal sequences.]     If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show     your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll     have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out     the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.     Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence     in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ... +-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+ +-------------------------------------------------------+---- \XX/ -------+     
Note that if you get the external CD300 for your Centris or Q800 you will miss out on the sound mixing feature unless you are willing to run a wire from the motherboard sound input connector to the stereo output on the CD.  Connecting to the sound input port on the back of the computer won't do unless you can live with mono.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems. That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination. Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions. The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12. As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case. We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say "Buy all you want, we'll support more." --  ----          ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!

I can't use 3 chip simms in my  computer, and when I replaced them, the problem vanished, forever.

Our student association runs a small Novell network which has a subnetwork of Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft Mail. The Director of Finance, en electrical engineering student, would like to gateway this system, either via SLIP or not, into the University's network and thus the Internet, at the very least to exchange e-mail, but possibly also to do ftp's etc. For now, this would be done via a 9600 bps modem. He would like to set it up so that it would periodically call in to check mail, but would otherwise connect whenever needed. What is the best way to do this? Gatewaying software is available, but what works best? with a cc: to the other. I don't read all of these groups regularly, so mail is best.

This past winter I found myself spending a ridiculous amout of time in front of my computer.  Since my eyes were going berserk, I decided to shell out some serious money to upgrade from a 14" to a 17" monitor.  I'm running 800x600 at 72 Hz.  My eyes are very grateful.  However, I find myself using a smaller font with less eye strain.  Has anyone else had this kind of  experience?  I thought that small fonts were the culprit but it seems that flicker was my real problem.  Any comments? Alec Lee
Sorry if this is a FAQ.  I don't normally read comp.sys.mac.hardware. I am purchasing a couple of Centris 650's.  I configured the systems as follows: 	Eight (8) Mb RAM 	Ethernet 	1 Mb VRAM 	Math CoProcessor option My purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent me the Apple summary documentation to prove it.  I ordered the coprocessor option, but I'm really not sure that we needed it.  I thought the '040 chip had a math coprocessor built into it.  Has Apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the '040 chip in the Centris 650? I am concerned that I may have set up a hardware bottleneck.  Please send your is enough interest.  Thanks! -- David Guevara,

(s. C't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92) 50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design. Better OSs (OS/2 & iX) are able to handle more than 16MB of DRAM, if you use EISA-Bus. Has someone experience with VLB ?? I think of SCSI-VLB-Busmaster. The problem is the 16bit Floppy DMA controller, which is unable to reach more than 16MB. Joerg

The only reason to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep  in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet. This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most people and has a great price. If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs. 16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again. --  ______________________________________________________________________________ |Joe Finete                                                                   | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have looked through the FAQ sections and have not seen a answer for this. I have an X/Motif application that I have written. I have a couple of gif files (or pict) that I have scanned in with a color scanner.  Now I would like to be able to convert the gif files into a format that could be read into my application and displayed on the background of its main window. Preferably with pixmaps, or perhaps as an XImage. I have found functions in the pbmplus program suite to convert gif to xbm, but that is monochrome, and I really do need color. I have looked at xv, which reads in gif, and writes out several formats, but have not found a way to write out a file which can be read in as a pixmap. Is there an easy way to do this? email responses preferred. thanks!

Hi, I'm looking to buy a 17" monitor soon, and it seems that I can't decide what monitor I should buy. I have a MAG 17S (this is a .25 dpi version and it using a TRINITON tube) and a NANAO 560i in mind. Does anyone know of any specification or problems these monitor have? Actually, any related opinions at buying a 17" monitor will be welcomed.  Thanks in advance,

My 2 cents worth: The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker.  A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach. Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard. LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard, if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work. If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board. Hope this helps. Dan Moyer

Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications BESIDES I.C.C.M.? I've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it but nobody SHOWS you how.  O'Reilly has no examples, ICCM has no examples, Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at, if they discuss ICC at all, simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and then refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and  Properties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had my applications talking to each other. I am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent  of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  But within X one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups. I need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best for which purpose, and gives examples.  Without examples it's all just words. Thanks in advance Ross

I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So  your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything )  Alex. -- __  __|       \      __|       Alex Colburn                      |       /   \    |          Image Analysis Facility          |      _____ \   __|	       University of Iowa

They are working ok, but your definitions in QVTNET.INI and QVTHOST.RC are incorrect (see below). >The docs said if you are running concurrent packet software you need to   >load PKTMUX???  Does this apply to me??? No, I don't think so. You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't you? They use different packet types, so QVTNET (TCP/IP) and NOVELL (IPX/SPX) should be able to coexist just fine. PKTMUX is required if you are using different TCP/IP-Packages concurrently. >This is the qvthost.rc file. >137.112.5.2 >137.112.199.50 There is the first problem: You didn't specify hostnames, just IP-Addresses. Your file should look like this: 137.112.5.2        <Name of your Nameserver> 137.112.199.50     <Name of your Router> >This is the beginning of the winqvt.ini file. >[net] >name=swartzjh.test.rose-hulman.edu Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part. >router=137.112.199.50 Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also, but  apparently they don't. >nameserver=137.112.5.2 Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the IP address. It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than one nameserver. The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work.

Is there aything available for X similar to QuicKeys for the Macintosh -- something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes, menu selections, and mouse actions - directing them towards another application? If so, could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not, how hard do we think it might be to send input to other X applications and, hopefully, deal with their responses appropriately?  (If an application is going to take a few seconds to process I probably have to wait  for it to complete before sending another command.) thanks, david,

First of all, without wanting to sound nagging and bossy, yes it is a trivial answer and that's perfectly fine ( otherwise how is one supposed to move up to the complicated and challenging questions, we net readers so much enjoy :) ?), and the massive crossposting of your article was not  justified...

I have used both my serial ports with a modem and a serial printer,  so I cannot use Appletalk.  Is there a Ethernet to Localtalk hardware that will let me use the Ethernet port on my Q700 as a Localtalk  port.  Until they come out with satellite dishes that sit on your window & give you internet access from your home, I won't at all be using that port. Saurabh.

I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it.  My needs are much the same as what you describe.  In addition, I wanted to get one that I could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of inexpensive  printers from Apple.  The print quality is good to excellent based on what  font you're using and what paper you use.  I'm still experimenting with  different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work fine. Printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed jobs is very easy.  There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of the sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet from the sheet feeder, as some do). (I have no affiliation with GCC, just a satisfied customer.) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Earl D.

	... 	Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the  	maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the 	characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility 	in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font 	file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters 	appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters. And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac.  No difference there between T1 and TT!    And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading') 	For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows 	char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font 	is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac 	char set. 	 Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding. The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example, you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a font may very well have them. ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the `fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?    > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road    > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503 Berthold K.P.

Another company, Congruent Corporation of New York City, has also ported Xlib Xt and Motif 1.1 over to MS Windows NT, which provides full client development for X applications in an NT environment. If you are porting InterViews over to MS Windows, I thought InterViews was a C++ toolkit with C++ classes. If that is so, how can it be built on Xlib, unless the classes are calling Xlib functions?

>I'd appreciate if you can email or post you positive >or negative experience with this monitor, especially >compared to to Nanao 550i. >I'd summarize if I got multiple responses. I bought a Viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week I took it back.  I  felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor. The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all. There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy. I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy. I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models  straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of  all models. --  Standard employer disclaimers apply --  Keith W.

Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms   I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the   shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an   extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to   test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled   in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this   transparent.   As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting.   The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this   code can Email me. 				Regards, 					Richard Gooch,

Here is a sample command: 	xterm -sl 999 -n ls12i -title ls12i -e rlogin ls12i & The -n and -title options give the text for window and icon.

It is executed each time before printing the prompt. So, I have the current host name and the current directory path in the title bar of my xterms. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------       ____                                                                       UniDo  /  Ingolf Markhof  University of Dortmund, LS Informatik XII           ___/   /                   P.O.

I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding your post, but DRAM *does not* have to be refreshed on *each access cycle*.  So cycle time does *not* have to be twice the access time *because of refresh phase*. The access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw address strobe (RAS) to data bus driven.

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry  option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now is: How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour. Thanks for any hints ---> Robert PS: I'm working in plain X. ****************************************************************************** * Robert Gasch	       * Der erste Mai ist der Tag an dem die Stadt ins      * * Oracle Engineering   * Freihe tritt und den staatlichen Monopolanspruch    * * De Meern, NL	       * auf Gewalt in Frage stellt                          * ******************************************************************************

I can't : see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great, re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93 This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows. One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem. There are three reasons for the problem: 1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't. 2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a    16550". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn't even    know what a UART was. 3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves. If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be. The Hardware Situation. The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt. The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491. So, what UART component do you have? Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers "8250" or "16450", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board. If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The "N" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the "A" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK). Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them). If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom). Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from: JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US The MCT-AIO+ (and the "+" is important) sells for $89.95.

I have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards with 16550s: TSD Systems (407) 331-9130 $19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing. The Software Situation Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above "CBR_128000".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps. These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "4.0". You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of "TurboCom", current version 1.2, from: Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed. I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers. Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes. I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky. Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems. Closing Soapbox Comments The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O. You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs "sort of" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by the modem. > If Answer is NO, should I change IRQ's for com ports to be different?  And, > does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too? Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport  ( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4, you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8. Michael --
Just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. Top three contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the biggest "cult following", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any tweaking. The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables & all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty... USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended; it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model from PC outlets for $190. All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how it works in two weeks or so. --  Eric Behr, Illinois State University, Mathematics Department

I have a feeling that your problems are not with the card or drivers.  The ATI Ultra drivers are considered some of the most reliable on the market, and the SS 24X ones  seem quite good as well.  Maybe you should check BIOS problems in your Gateway.  I know a few people with Gateway DX2's, and all of them have found some problem or other with compatibility -- especially with graphics. The only GPF's I have ever had can be directly attributable to using/ abusing applications.  I even got the newest drivers from Diamond when  people started complaining.  I still only have one small problem with them, and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes/ reads to the swap file.   Greg Bishop.
I need help binding some value to the HOME and END keys on my keyboard.  I have an rs/6000 w/ aix3.2.3ext running X11R5pl19 mit dist.  I'm using a PC running eXceed for windows as my xterminal.  The HOME and END keys do not send a value, and my application needs them to be defined.  I used this in my Xdefaults to define the keys: varnet*VT100.Translations: #override \ Then I xterm -name varnet.  This works perfect, however the 7 and the 1 key on my keypad are also defined as \033[8~ and \033[7~. Any ideas?  Help please. Thanks. --  Egan F. Ford

Reposting and summarizing, for your information or additional comment. *** THIS IS LONG *** I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).  I have been running Mathcad 3.1, under Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5MB RAM drive, 2MB/1MB Smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) for several months. I am interested in the faster Mathcad 4.0, but I am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft's claim about increased speed.

So far, in response to a less detailed description of my setup, or in unrelated postings, the more informed answers, on the net or by E-mail, appear to be:    >> According to Mathsoft, no. Mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as    >> not to overburden the physical resources. They say this is actually a    >> win32s feature. A figure of 10MB was indicated to me as a minimum.

I have a chance to buy a used PS/2 Appletalk card to create a network with my home machines.  However, the guy who has the card tells me there's a DB-9 or DB-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather than the 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that I expect.  This sounds more like a Thicknet ethernet card.  Should there be a transciever on it, like on the Quadras?  What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of these cards, keeping in mind that it's Micro-Channel Architecture, which means take your best guess and double it. Thanks.

: Hello all you windows freaks out there. :  : I bought Windows 3.1 (dutch version) some time ago, and run it on a : 286. I recently upgraded my computer to a 486DX33, 256K cache, 4M memory, : 212M Maxtor HD. Works real fine, but not with windows. :  : When playing Patience (SOL) or minesweeper, suddenly the system hangs: : - I just can't move my mouse anymore. : or : - Screen goes blank, nothing further : or : - Screen goes blank, computer seems to reboot, but stops before reaching : the end of the memory test. :  : Once (or maybe even twice) I got a message about some illegal kernel call : or something (accompanied by a hex adress) and a close-button. When pressing : it, the application wouldn't close, though. :  : I haven't experienced this problem with other programs than these, but that's : mainly because I haven't really used other programs. I suspect them to hang  : too. :  : Anything known about this problem. (Or, better, any patches available?) :  :  : Oh, forgot to tell, if, in CMOS RAM, I make the computer faster (higher : bus speed, less wait states, enable both caches etc), the crash comes : faster (after 10 min. or so). If I deliberately slow the system down : (slow bus speed, wait states, disable internal/external cache, no : shadowing) the crash comes later, but comes. :  : Hope anyone can help. :  : Wouter. :  :  Hi, I got a problem too, with a 486DX2-66 VLB, 4 Mb RAM,  170Mb disk. Sometimes, when I switch on the computer, it starts Windows (3.1 Dutch) Windows switches to 1024x768, switches back to text-mode and exits to DOS. After one or two resets, the system works fine...

>I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits. >I tried using the following Xlib code : >Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth Yes. >and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ? Look up XV_DEPTH.  Also, you might want to try using XView colormap segments instead of Xlib for your colormap stuff.  They will probably be easier for you to use, and since you are using a TrueColor visual, you won't be losing anything compared to straight Xlib.
              at Oracle Corporation.  The opinions expressed are those               of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle. As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of   late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every   day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I   can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same   application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application   that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I   need to re-boot. Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard. The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.  I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes? What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe. Any help is truly appreciated..... -Eric
Please reply via e-mail since this is job related:  I have a Colorado Jumbo back-up system at one of my places of  employment and it has eaten two tapes by winding the tape off the spool. Is there an easy fix or is the tape drive fried? Does it simply need  cleaning? Any and all comments will be appreciated!

I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.  It's pretty much working, but I'm encountering a weird error.  I'm attempting to start an xterm from my .xsession file, but nothing happens.  Redirecting stderr to a file using 'exec 2>$HOME/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message:   "xterm: Error 14, errno 1: Not owner" Now, if I start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line, it works fine.  And starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm), and a clock, from my .xsession also works. Anyone encountered this?

However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM. So, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time SEEING the grayscale image you want to print.

It definitely will  help speed things up. A 2 megs smartdrv is also a good idea with  the amount of memory you have, and use fastdisk (32bit access) if  you not already. Hope that help.. 					N. Ngo
We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of groups.  Sorry for the cross posting. Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines. (See the diff marks at the right hand edge)  The rules and guidelines for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry  about these changes. =-= #!/bin/sh # This is part 02 of a multipart archive # ============= mkentry.c ============== echo "x - extracting mkentry.c (Text)" sed 's/^X//' << 'SHAR_EOF' > mkentry.c && X/* X * Copyright (c) Landon Curt Noll & Larry Bassel, 1993.

X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see "The New Hacker's Dictionary" by Eric Raymond) X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May. X X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address X    above and use the subject 'send rules'. X X    One may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from: X X	host: ftp.uu.net	(192.48.96.9) X	user: anonymous X	dir:  ~/pub/ioccc X X    As a last resort, previous winners may be obtained by sending Email X    to the above address.  Please use the subject 'send YEAR winners', X    where YEAR is a single 4 digit year, a year range, or 'all'.

Its purpose: X X    * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details. X    * To applaud those with the best tricks. X    * To prove  that humans can  beat those damnable  machine generators at X      their own game by writing  the most obscure and mysterious PostScript X      programs ever. X X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide. X X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually X    in the obfuscated directory.

Hey all...I got an equation editor, and since it didn't automagically appear in my "object" dialog box (i.e. insert-->object-->equation), I decided to manually place it there.  So I went into win.ini (is there another way to do this?), the [embedding] section, and added  equation=equation,equation,<path\filename>,picture. didn't work. quit windows, go back.  AHA: mistake. Correct it.  It looks fine. start windows...doesn't work.  play with it for a while, at one point having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't, and finally I get it to work.  The only thing I can see that's different now is that it's now the first item on the list, and it used to be the last.  But now I end up with *three* "equation" entried, and *all* of them working. (and only one entry in win.ini). so does any netian know what's wrong? or rather, how to correct this? (i.e. make "equation"appear but once?). Also, all the entries in the [embedding] appear as above. It's obvious that <path\filename> is the executable, or whatever, and "picture" has something to do withthe way it appears (picture/description?) but what are the others? i.e., in soundrec=sound,sound, whate's the difference between the 1st "sound" and the 2nd?   and what is "soundrec"?? (I don't think it's the name of the executable, as other entries (e.g. MSWorksChart=...) aren't) thanks, i.a.

I have a Laserwriter IIg that has disappeared completely from the Network, i.e. it's name doesn't show up in any zone.  (You can print to it from it's serial interface, tho!)  I have seen some discussion here about changing the zone a IIg is in... including some PS code that lets you change the zone.  Is there maybe some PS code you can use to have it go back to all its factory default settings?  I have a feeling that's what needed to heal ours. --  South Hadley, MA, USA            | request with a list of all items currently --Unix is dead, long live Unix-- | available for purchase... -RFC1288

I have only one report, which seems to indicate that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com) So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.

Hi,    I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programs for the sound blaster. The first of which is a CMF voice editor which is hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as I can get it to  an FTP site). Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play the FM synth remotely. The problem is that I have little or no info on the SB midi port. I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines, however this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and loss the of note velocity data byte. I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments may help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to have all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyone has this book could they please mail me. My second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file  format be standard if you keep it secret ?) I need to know the file format  for instrument bank files *.BNK and Roland music files *.ROL. Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA or VGA monitors. Please Help, You know it makes sense. Colin
Hay all:     Has anyone out there heard of any performance stats on the fabled p24t.  I was wondering what it's performance compared to the 486/66 and/or pentium would be.  Any info would be helpful.

:  : What are the current products available to upgrade the resolution? : Which ones support postscript? :  : Any experiences with them, either good or bad? :  : Is the quality difference really noticable? :  : I'm planning on producing camera ready copy of homes.  Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? :  If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS. The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient. We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though). I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be surprised if there are several. Gordon Lang
Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts. This is a uuencoded bitmap.  960X600 256 colors. The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background. The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image quality and resolution - I have not seen much better. For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here is how to put it back together. 	1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files 	2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer 	   in each file. 	3. concatinate all the parts into a single file 	4. uudecode the file There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know. ------------ Part 1 of 14 ------------ begin 644 ROMAN.BMP MB>HT/%D42'%=7<Y$1'V9F?_*B8DL,%D858&=KO^-MKH<89&5H?_*:6DDA<HL M5?\H)%W*LK*VMK9978E]A?I,55DHA<XP,&'&^OI$2%F)D?(44'G*D9%]F:%E M8?HP.%5(885,68FAMOIM>;+*<7'*QL:VXO\878V5G>Y`4%UA<84<:9TX1%T0 M4*6AH:$\,%EM:>J5KN)A8;I(4%D\1&6=LO;*>7EI=:ZZZOH,-%`X.%E$4&DT M-*&EOOH00&&=NNHLC=;*KJZZZO\43'&5I?I9686ESMZRYNX00&5$/&6JVNX4 M3'7*C8T<'%G2^O^!D<X8685$1%EIA9D43'DX0%7*;6W*PL*VWOH868E`3%F^ MB<YUD9U077E096E$0*6RTOK*MK8X0&6^\OI(4'FJQOJ9QL8HB=*9D?](2/(` M``````````````````````````````````````#':6DO.FDZ.CJ1D4&1.I&& MV);8<SQS<VW8<VW8V,K*RLISECQMV',\V-AM/&U!/,I!<W-M<VW8RMC*ECS8 MRMC*.G/*V&W8RLIS<W/*<T&6<\IM<]A!;7,ZRMAS<W/*RD'8;3HZRMC*V#K* MV-C8RMC*.FW8V#HO.B_8.LK8.MC8RLHORMC*;<HZV#HO.CK8+SK*.B\OV#K8 M.B\ZRCHO+\HZ;<HZ.CK8.CK8.LHZ.LK*RLHZ<W/*06W*;3K*.CK*V-C8;<IM M;3IS;=AS.D'*;9;*RLIS;<K8RMASV&W8V-AS<W-S<W-SRG,\;<J6/'-S<W-M M/',\1=AS/#R6/',\V#QM/&US<Y8\/#P\13S1<]&6/#QS/$71/-W=T9;=T3P\ M<T71/-%%1='1/-%%/-W1/#P\T3S=13S1W=UWT44\=T7=T7=WW='=W7=%=]W1 MW=UWT=V%=X7=W='=T=UWA4"%A4E`=]W=0$E)W4!W=W>%W=UWW7=)=W=`=W=W M2>-`A4!)2>/C=W?CA>-)=^-)22-WXTE)XTGCXX6%0.-)0$!)X^-)X^/C2>/C MXTE[X^/CXTGCX^/C>^/CX^/CBDF*24E[BN/7XXKCBN.*BN/CX^-[XXKCXWLR MX^/CBHJ*,GOC>S).>^/C,HI.XS**,GN*3GN*BDXRBHI8,GN*6(I8BHJ*BC(R M6(J*>S**BDXRBHI.,O/S3DY.Y_-.BN=.,HJ*6//G\_.*,DY8YS)8Y_-8\TY.

I wonder if anyone can tell me whether or not I can create a bitmap of any size?  I followed the bitmap creation example in SDK manual and specified a 24x24 bitmap (set the width/height to 24) and supplied a byte string with 72 chars.  But I just cannot get the right bitmap image.  I changed the width/height to 32x32 and used the same value string (padded with zero byets to make up to the right size) and got the image. The example in the manual is 64x32 size, which are multiple of 2 bytes. Can you define a bitmap image of any size? Thanks very much. -- G.

I am in the process of modifying an X application that uses Xlib.  I'd like to include a timer-driven facility (for network polling), but cannot see how to do it using Xlib.  I know it can be done with Xaw, using XtAppAddTimeout and XtTimerCallBackProc.  How do I do the same using Xlib? Thanks for any help.  Please email. -- Dave Wilson Computing Centre, Rhodes University Grahamstown, South Africa
We're about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers. Yes indeed, difficult to comprehend why anyone would want to accelerate a MacPlus, but that's another story. Suffuce it to say, we can get accelerators easier than new machines. Hey, I don't make the rules... Anyway, on to the purpose of this post: I'm looking for info on MacPlus acelerators.  So far, I've found some lit on the Novy Accelerator and the MicrMac MultiSpeed Accelartor. Both look acceptable, but I would like to hear from anyone who has tried these.  Also, if someone would recommend another accelerator for the MacPlus, I'd like to hear about it. Thanks for any time and effort you expend on this! Karl

If you use System 7, you can use my application Zing which has a 30 kB footprint (meaning you can have it running all the time without losing memory) It is also compatible with the chat program "FishBomb" which allows sounds and pictures as well. Both are, as far as I know, freeware (I dustribute Zing with source) and should be available on the normal services (mac.archive.umich.edu for instance) Cheers, 					/ h+ --     This signature is kept shorter than 4 lines in the interests of UseNet    S/N ratio.
I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good advice. We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk, and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some problems: The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive. If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each (1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work? Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk? What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them installed in the other disk. The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets ID #1. The old one should have ID #0. It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk. Thank you! ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyone know what would cause my IIcx to not turn on when I hit the keyboard switch?  The one in the back of the machine doesn't work either... The only way I can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes, then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately... Sometimes this doesn't even work for a long time... I remember hearing about this problem a long time ago, and that a logic  board failure was mentioned as the source of the problem...is this true? 		Thanks, 		T.J. Pilon
Hi Netters! I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario: 1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).     The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both      systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup /      restore program.  Both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies. 2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon). From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these  options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees  any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking  (I don't know very much about these beasts): 1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.     Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?     What do the floppies themselves cost? 2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and     continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a     few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any     happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?   3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and     (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?) 4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or      recommendations for manufacturers?   I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will summarize all responses for the net.

>	I'm interested in getting a 14" color monitor for my new LCIII. >Unfortunately, I'm really quite confused with the Sony monitors. >Could someone please compare the Sony 1320, 1304 and the Apple 14"?  >					Thanks. Dan Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD- 1304 because of several manufacturing flaws.  The new model is now the 1430, which just like Apple's new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches. I'm not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools bookstore and can tell you that nearly half of them were returned with some kind of  defect or another. Just my two cents worth.

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of groups.  Sorry for the cross posting. Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines (See the diff marks at the right hand edge).  The rules and guidelines for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry  about these changes. =-= #!/bin/sh # This is a shell archive (shar 3.32) # Source directory /tmp # # existing files WILL be overwritten # # This shar contains: # length  mode       name # ------ ---------- ------------------------------------------ #   8971 -r--r--r-- rules #  25592 -r--r--r-- guidelines #  34482 -r--r--r-- mkentry.c #   6418 -r--r--r-- obfuscate.info # # ============= rules ============== echo "x - extracting rules (Text)" sed 's/^X//' << 'SHAR_EOF' > rules && X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Rules X XCopyright (c) Landon Curt Noll & Larry Bassel, 1993.

It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X	       digit, followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       | X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    | X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      | X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program. X X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from X    a short example!

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y" X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.

I assume you're using the driver available from cica (hp4-v108.zip). Bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel. Click on the "Options" button brings up another screen of choices. Change the "Graphics Mode" from "HP-GL/2" to "Raster" and check the box "Print Truetype as graphics (this is only available when you choose "Raster"). Now you should be able to print all your truetype fonts correctly. Good luck. Lei Shao
	The Quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware, read's PRAM, obtains all info from last session including the volume setting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and wait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code. If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device, or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the  'sad mac' sound. This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac. If you cannot control the volume of the quadra, even at boot up, then i feel there is something incorrect with the logic board.  My Quadra 700 does not show the problems you are having. Steve H
I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video in my IIci and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13" monitor. What's the deal on them? 1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max and min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits? 2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24? 3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem? How much slower is it? 4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT, or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non- Microsloth) apps, for example)? 5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position, let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it. Thanks a lot for you input. Rick ------------------------------------------------------------------- The early bird got worms.

BTW, the deal >I have is a C650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better >deal? I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the price of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer. Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next week (heh). Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them again (grin). -John

I know that Jet Inc makes refills for the Stylewriter and Deskwriter ink jet cartridges in several colors....but are pre-filled cartridges in color available from anyone (or do I have to use-up one cartridge  before I have a chance to print in color?) Also, are inks in process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) available to refill cartridges? Thanks in advance....
>   Actually, I must also ask the FAQ's #1 most popular reason why graphics >   don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your >   rectangle? Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the Window is mapped. The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to "tickle" a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?
I am doing a report on the topic of 'Advanced Memory Management' and need to know of some good references to cover this topic.  It is an  Analytical Chemistry class on Instrumental Analysis.  So, as you  could guess, it doesn't have to be an extremely thorough or extensive covering of the topic.  Also, I am a Chemical Engineer and know some, but not too much about memory management.  If anyone could help point  me in a good direction I would be very thankful. Thanks in advance. School of Chemical Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta, GA  30332-0100
We have recently obtained a Centris 610 and it has developed an unusual video problem.  Model:	610 with 8 MB/230 HD, 512K VRAM, no cards Monitor:	Apple 16" When the computer is set for 256 colors and certain operations are done, particularly vertical scrolling through a window, horizontal white lines appear on the monitor (which generally but not always spare open windows).  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued.  If a window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away the line disappear from that area of the screen.  This problem is not observed if the monitor is configured for 16 colors or a 14 inch Apple monitor with 256 colors is used.  I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain.  The problem has been apparent since day 1 but has gotten worse. We were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this, and if so, how for your help.

I have a .BAT file that I run under a Windows Icon.  I have set up a PIF file to run the BAT file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen. The first line of the BAT file sets an environment variable. My problem is that on some of our machines (running MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode), the SET command in the BAT file fails with the OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error.  I have raised the amount of environment  space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that I am nowhere near to running out.  If I just click on the MS-DOS icon, I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell.  The problem is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in a BAT file fails.  Has anyone seen such behavior before?  I see no place in the PIF fail to configure environment space.   Carson, CA  90746

I was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system that has a color hardcopy unit: 	xwd | xwud -display hostname:0.0 I had tested it with some simple windows like the OpenWindows file manager, and it worked fine, but when I tried it with a more complex (larger) image, the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault.  I tried it without the pipe, by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud and got the same error from xwud.  If I had to guess, it seems like it's running out of memory, but this happened on a SPARC 10 with 64 megs, 128 meg swap space, and only one user with minimal activity.  The file was about 3 MB. This verion of xwd/xwud was supplied with the Sun OpenWindows 3.0 distribution which I believe corresponds to X11 R4. Any ideas?  Thanks in advance. --  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dave Humes        |    Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have just a few quick questions.  Does anyone here have a 486 DLC system? (a Cyrix 486 DX)  Any problems with it?   Second, how much should a Cyric 486DLC-33 motherboard (with no RAM) run me?   3rd...Should a total amatuer (like myslef) be able to perform a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician, or is it beyond hope? 4th...I hear that some (if not all) hard drives may require reformatting if you switch them to another computer (or motherboard as the case may be).  Is there any truth to this? Any replies would be greatly appreciated.

Hello folks! I have an Archive XL5580 (internal QIC-80) tape drive, which is pretty comparable to the Colorado Jumbo 250.  Since I have two floppy drives in my system, I'm using a small card (not accelerated) made by Archive to  attach my tape drive as a third floppy device. The problem: Although the DOS-based QICstream software works just fine, both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless I switch the machine to non-turbo speed (I'm using a 486DX/33 EISA).  Since the DOS software works, it can't be a hardware problem, can it?  Has anyone seen similar problems?  Any solutions?

The si has a single expansion slot, that can be either PDS or Nubus, but not both together. The card lies parallel to and above the motherboard & HD and requires an adaptor slot to do this. There are Nubus and PDS adaptort cards. Thus, what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you have. With the exception of the Radius rocket, all NuBus cards I know of work in the si. PDS slots and thus cards are Mac specific, thus not all PDS cards work in all Macs.  **** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

Interestingly enough, the CDROM 300i that came with my Quadra 800 has  only 8 disks: 1. System Install 2. Kodak Photo CD sampler 3. Alice to Ocean 4. CDROM Titles 5. Application Demos 7. Nautilus 8. Apple Chronicles Has anyone else noticed that they got less than everyone seems to be getting with the external?  What I really feel I missed out on is what is supposed to a fantastic Games demo disk. I have heard that people have gotten up to 9-10 disks with their drive. I assume they get the 8 titles above plus Cinderella and the Games Demo CDROM. any comments and experiences?  Should I call Apple to complain? =) Derek

I am going absolutely INSANE. > I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos, > or just me. >  Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was   trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way. Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too. I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is   pretty standard. Hope this helps, -Avery

Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway. I am running xterm and like all UNIX users, I run man <something>. Recently, I switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with ".I" directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm. The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at. Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining.... So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under ".I" directives  for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (".B"  directives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit the man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font, but not an italic font?? Any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks -- John P.S. Running xterm -rv won't work, I tried...

Simply, Windows seems to only support mice on COM1 or COM2. The funny part is, though, that Microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse sitting on COM3.

The Andrew User Interface System is supported, maintained, enhanced, and distributed by the Andrew Consortium, Carnegie Mellon.  The distribution terms are those of the X consortium, not the GNU Public License.  Thus anyone can commercially exploit the Andrew code without restriction.  (To encourage membership, however, we defer universal release of the latest versions until Consortium members have had an opportunity to explore the new capabilities.) To se what AUIS looks like, you can try a remote demo.  You need an X server (R5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet.  Give the command  for instructions. NOTE:  The demo version does not use the Motif-look-and-feel scrollbar, but one is available.  You can use it on the demo by changing an option in the ~/preferences file and starting a new editor. The Andrew Toolkit component of AUIS is ideal if you want to build applications using compound documents.  Andrew's major feature is its architecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table in figure in text, for example.  This architecture extends to areas not usually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and printing. Andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications:  word processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter two are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tape in December.)

I am going to be getting a C650 soon, but I don;t want Apple  to come out with the Cyclones and the Tempest in a month and have the price drop on the system I want.  I have negotiated a  good deal with a supplier for a C650 8/80 and I would like to jump on it, but, again, I don't want the price drop to smuther me.  BTW, the deal I have is a C650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better deal? thanks, -nate
I read about the development of EISA-2 some time ago but dismissed it in light of the intense interest in VESA and PCI.  However, I recently was disheartened to hear that ISA cannot address more than 16mb of RAM, a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon. I recall that EISA-2 will support 64-bit transfer among other enhancements. Is there such a standard being developed? --  Bing Ho

Salutations! 	I don't usually subscribe to these newsgroups so I would really appreciate it if someone could possibly e-mail me the answer to my problem. I have been using Windows 3.1 since buying it last winter but I have just now come across an annoying bug. I now have about 8 different groups in program manager but it seems that everytime I install something new that makes a new group, it promptly disappears after I turn of windows! This happened when I installed Excel and WinFax Pro v.3. They both created their own groups but when I turned off windows and reran them, they were gone. I had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as I turn off windows. 	my set up: 			precision 386dx-25 w/ 4 megs 			Trident 8900c with 1 meg  			Windows 3.1 running in 800x600 colour mode 			logitech mouseman 			 Thank you in advance!

Since swapping out my generic VGA card for a Diamod Speedstar 24X, I have  noticed two new problems: * if I create a windowed MS-DOS session (386 mode), when the text starts     to scroll, rather than printing characters it starts to print    horizontal lines that spill out to the desktop and trash the entire     display.  Ctrl-alt-del terminates the dos window and restores the     desktop * after a short time in NCD's PC X-remote for windows, all characters     displayed on the desktop are changed to be unreadable; I am unable to   restore without rebooting. These are in both 256 and 16 color 800x600 drivers, large and small fonts. DOS 5, Win 3.1, emm386 and smartdrv installed. I like the speed of the card and have had no other problems.  Any ideas?

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo properly? When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches when ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've had the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to grab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks while I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or SCSI etc.  (BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't want to slide out any more). --  Phil Jimmieson,           *********************************************** PO Box 147                *********************************************** Liverpool  L69  3BX      "I was head over heels in love until I got cramp" (UK) 051-794-3689

Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy,  2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility, 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual  manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found  it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features. Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better. The following files are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries What tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional 	processing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1 New features: Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the  file type will be automatically detected. Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file. The hex format has been changed. New time options have been added. Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets. Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag) New flags: -R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin -ttt	prints delta times -tttt	prints times relative to the first frame -W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's  X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi. Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so. We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is. We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'. //I18N.h // This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*- #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H #include <X11/Xlib.h> extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,	/* IN */ 				 int wc_len,		/* IN */ 				 char *buf,		/* OUT */ 				 int *buflen,		/* IN/OUT */ 				 int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */ 				 char **charset);	/* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc); #endif /* _I18N_H */ //I18N.cc #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include "I18N.h" extern "C" { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include "Xlocaleint.h" #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid     extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int, 					 char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);     extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID); }; int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */ 			  int wc_len,		/* IN */ 			  char *buf,		/* OUT */ 			  int *buf_len,		/* IN/OUT */ 			  int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */ 			  char **charset)	/* OUT */ {     XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();     int ctid;     int status;     Charset *xcharset;          status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf, 				       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == Success) { 	xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid)); 	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;     }     else 	*charset = NULL;     return status; } ---------------- An included file above, "Xlocaleint.h", is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled. A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01. When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:     _Xmbctidtocsid (code)     _Xmbfscs (code)     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)     _XFallBackConvert (code) We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to  know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used  its internal functions.  The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution. My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5. In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source  files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal.  Any help or comments would be highly appreciated. I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation.

I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for $99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the  fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos.

Some >send data to both, some only send data to the left channel >(the first is preferrable, of course) Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound. The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines). When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant "I want to play a mono sound" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound. Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy. Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons. If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games. The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have. Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: >Lemmings >Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW) >Glider 4.0 >OIDS and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested) Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras. Other games you list: >Armor Alley >Spectre >Spaceward Ho! and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience) Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines. The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it. In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware. Have fun. Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions. Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like "the grace period is about to end" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean. Disclaimer number 3: I don't speak for Apple, just me. -Steve Bollinger

The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset of the 68851's functions.  If you look underneath your front left floppy bay you will find three chips, all approximately the same size.  One will be the 68020, the next the 68881, and the third, approximately the same size, will be the Apple chip.  It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump' in the middle of it.

I am having problems with a  Motif application that when run on another machine (with different X paths, etc) can't find the XKeysymDB file.   This causes a large warning output: Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfActivate:ManagerParentActivate()' Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfCancel:ManagerParentCancel()' Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfSelect:ManagerGadgetSelect()' ... .... .... etc. as the file is in a different location, but Xt seems to only look for it in the place where it is on the machine the app was compiled on.  Is there any way to read the XKeysymDB manually with an X/Xt call so that additions to the XKeysymDB can be distributed with the application ?  I have used trace(1) to find out what was going on, but I need a fix so that these translations in the application can be recognised. --tim ________________________________________________________________________________   Tim Liddelow                                          for(;;) fork();   Systems Programmer   Centre of Advanced Technology in Telecommunications   My brain on a bad day.

No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story. Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the "experts". My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO drive and Sharp scanner has one for each. Good luck. Art Beattie ============================================================== I only speak for myself. ==============================================================

Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBM-PC and Mac. The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself (but with the correct software each can read the others) and maybe the cable (depends on your SCSI board on IBM-PC). If you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBM-formatted disk and the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBM-PC syquest. good luck, --Paul --    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+   | P.O.

I have a peculiar color problem with MacX, Apple's Macintosh X server. I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. It's happened with the current version (1.2), and with version 1.1.7. When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some Motif clients. --  Stan Kerr     Computing & Communications Services Office, U of Illinois/Urbana

The DIP switches are set the right way and the >Command and Option keys seem to work on anything else.  I'm running 7.1 btw. >Anyone know what the problem is? >-Terry Terry, hi.  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E.  I can't remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard. The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works. I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service lines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience. -David
Hi, looking for any advice or suggestions about a problem I'm having with MIT X11R5's editres, in particular under twm variants. For a start, 9 times out of 10 (but NOT always) editres won't grab a widget tree when running on our NCD (Decwindows) Xterms, which I'm told will be fixed when the R5 (not R4) XDm is installed. OK, so I tried running it on a Sun, running real R5, on the same network - I get a widget tree, but it's ALWAYS for 'TWM Icon Manager' Anybody know of any patches for (a) twm or (b) editres that I should look at? Thanks, K

I have some used, but working, parts available for the original IBM laptop - the PC Convertible.  If you have one of these things, and still are using it, you may have found out that IBM wants OUTRAGEOUS prices for parts.  I built up a supply of enough parts to keep mine going for a few years, and will be willing to part with the rest. Basically, I have all the standard parts EXCEPT: Motherboard Battery Power Supply I've got a few of the accessories, too - just ask. These are in very limited supply, however.  I've basically just cannibalized a couple of old machines. If you are interested, please e-mail me. superior because they have newer and better machines, or who want to inform me that these are "worthless junk," save your effort.  I'll just delete the note.  Those of us who bought these machines when they first came out still find them useful for word processing, etc..  I'm saving mine as a future antique.

Hi, I have got a Quantum ProDrive 80AT IDE harddisk and would like to format it. When trying to format it (*no* low-level format, just FDISK and DOS FORMAT), I somehow messed up the parameters... I had entered FDISK /MBR not exactly knowing what this does. The suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB. I tried type 25, but this gives only around 70MB and not the nominal 80MB. Could I use user type 47? However, I don't know the actual parameters (cylinders, heads,...) Could someone give me them? And how does FDISK work together with user type 47?

Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to this newsgroup.  The "test" was the following command: >Plot3D[((-2*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-5000)^2+(y-8000)^2+ >81000000)^1.5))+((-3*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-10000)^2+ >(y-1000)^2+81000000)^1.5))+((4*2000)/(2*3.1416* >((x-7000)^2+(y-10000)^2+4000000)^1.5)), >{x,-5500,19500},{y,-5500,19500},PlotPoints->50] I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and workstations.

I'm currently having trouble connecting my PB to a true blue (IBM Model 1513) VGA monitor.  The display is bearly readable but all the details are seperated into yellow and red colors. ie. a window will have two images one in yellow and a ghost image in red.  The background is also a little greenish.  I read some time ago, before I ever thought I would hook my mac up to a VGA screen, about an incompatability with some VGA monitors due to the sync on green signal.  Does this sound like it could be the same demon?  I also read that there are both hardware (putting a diode on the green signal?) solution and a software solution to this problem.  I don't the details does somebody have them the can e-mail to me or post them?  I checked all the FAQ's for this and didn't find anything about it.  Did I miss it somewhere?  This sure seems that it would be a good thing to have in one.  Thanks for any replys. Charles Kuehmann Northwestern University Steel Research Group
Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up. About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :) Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up to 160 meg, in any computer.  Don't know about CD-ROM, though.

My MacClassic mouse died.  I dissected it and determined that it is the microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressed mode.  This tragedy prompts the following questions: 1.	Is it easy to find a microswitch that I could solder into the 	place of the old switch ? 2.	I have old mice (Max+, Mac 512Ke), can they be used with some 	adapter ?
My Datadesk Mac 101E keyboard has similar problems. I have found that holding down the RIGHT-HAND shift key at startup will work (disable extensions), but the left-hand shift key won't (which is unfortunate, since the left one is the one I instinctively reach for). Similarly, I have trained myself to hold down the RIGHT-HAND pair of command-option for desktop rebuilds. I *is* irritating.

: This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a : way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit) : to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to : get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out! : I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns I'm not sure if this will work, but how about using one of those 'T' expanders used in the low-profile cases.  They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either side of the card.  You can install it in the last slot, and then (probably)  have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low profile cases - a standard motherboard, the 'T' connector in one slot,  and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at  each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.   The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics on it.  The only downside - your case won't close, but for a homebrew system, that may not be a problem. Don't know about performance, though.  I'll leave that discussion to the  engineers. =========================================================================== Gerry George                          | Anything good in life is either School of Management, Boston Univ.    | illegal, immoral or fattening. ===========================================================================

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to  build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also  takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).

Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set. Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels? If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?   Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape. If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.  If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair. --- Scott Hiles Standard disclaimer:   The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily    reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

Any clue? Some times when I enter Win 3.1 ProgMan says that I need to rebuild a group! It's quite annoying!
I have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different  speeds. There was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the SI uses timing loops anything like a Quadra for accessing its floppy drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. A Quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive.

The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened. It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain. I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal. I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it is a Quantum... ) Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine. But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous. And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay. Thanks for answers.

	I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines  	and I'm having real trouble.  My own Intel 14.4k ( 	v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it 	at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem, 	at the other machine, is a "Turbomodem+" from "The  	Complete PC" (the machines are in seperate houses,  	so a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this 	much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines 	on for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not 	pirated software).

[ Article crossposted from comp.os.ms-windows.apps ] [ Author was Dr. Richard Timmer ] [ Posted on 24 Apr 93 23:11:16 GMT ] Hello WinNetters: I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of  MS Access and Borland Paradox/Win.  However, are there any users out there  with experience with the database package called "Approach".  It has gotten a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it would require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a field to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz, 6 MB ram). So, please provide me with your thoughts are "Approach", good and bad.  Thanks. Richard Timmer

I have (had) several problems with the card. - Applications crashed when moving the mouse (VGA mode). Fixed by removing   the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256   does just fine. - Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a   256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning   off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics   mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.   With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the   window. - The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware   cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.   Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-   for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-   unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem? - The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. (Universal   VESA drivers do not run at all). ----------- DISCLAIMER: Unless otherwise stated, the above comments are entirely my own.   _____________            _____  /            /\  __    __/    /\ /____________/  \/ /\  / /____/  \            Jan van Loenen \________    \  /_/  \/_/\    \   \_____      Digital Equipment Corporation   \    \/_\    \/\ \/_/ /  \    \/____/ /     HLDE01::LOENEN_J    \___________/  \____/    \_________\/
  [stuff deleted] >Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a  >clock, *has* to make a Get Date system call? Apparently, the clock >hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The >Get Date call notices that a "midnight reset" flag has been set, and then >then advances the date. > >Anybody with more info? There are two 'problems': (1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit     for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight     will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the     meantime, and (2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'     call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So     unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by     the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to     increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.

Access time is, of course, somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data transfer rate. All the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer rates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment about drivers. Plus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800. A very nice feature if you need to install System software. I don't know if the NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines. Mark

Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at $25 per floptical (= $1.20 per megabyte), and I have seen them advertised in MacWEEK at $20 (< $1.00 per megabyte).  For someone on a tight budget, the fact that the minimal dollar increment for more storage is less---$25 versus $60---sometimes matters.

Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5. (The card is revision 5A) My detective work has shown that this jumper simply connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part of the ISA bus. The question I have is simple: To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X, what does the manual claim that this jumper does? To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the BALE line? On a related note: Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to the ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name chart, but that is it. -Douglas _________________________________________________________  ________   ___    ___   |_   __  \ |   |  |   |   Douglas R.

Anyone know what this is? >  >That is it - >  >Thanks a heap. >  >- Alan Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System.  Unline Win3.1, it does not  run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users. 	Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM. Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August. 	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.) 	Anyway, don't expect it soon.

I have a question regarding sending a NULL character across ethernet connection. The actual problem is that emacs (Unix editior) needs the NULL character for setting a mark and unfortunately we don't know how to sent that from IBM PCs across ethernet. I am wondering if anyboy knows the keyboard combination for sending the NULL character.  Thanks Saeid

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2? Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions. Randy   
I have a (very old) Mac 512k and a Mac Plus, both of which  have the same problem. Their screens blank out, sometimes after a minor physical jolt (such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive), sometimes  all by themselves (computer left to itself just goes blank). I have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the  video board, because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires made the screen come back on.  This worked for a while, but the blanking out has returned. Can I do anything?  Do I need a new power supply?  A new CRT? A new computer? Thanks for any advice... -------------------------- Ethan Bodin Tufts University --------------------------
 (Wayne Smith) writes:   [stuff deleted] >So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT >HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense. Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence. The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really does stink. Wally Bass
Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face: "Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?" Here's why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor in it. Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a "Semi-Portable" fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical now...  --  Travis Grundke		    | MacGames Digest- Your #1 Source for Information, Contributing Editor,	    | News & Reviews of Gaming Software and the Gaming  MacGames Digest	 	    | Industry in the Macintosh Community.

I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The hardware is "truecolor" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just present this static visual, but I'm not sure if this will be  acceptable to "most" X clients.  The three problems I see are:   1) The colormap, though huge, is static.   2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.   3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the      translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error. Being more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these limitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits,  but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary. I know there are no absolutes, but I'd appreciate hearing people's opinions and suggestions.  Thanks! --  Frederick G. M.

Could someone please do one of the following: 1. Point to an init that allows me to turn off power management on my    Duo 210. 1. Write an init that would allow me to turn off ALL power management on    Duo 210. 2. Point me to documentation on power management so that I can write such    an init. 3. Explain to me why such an init is totally or partially impossible. Ideally, of course, I would like to be able to turn in on and off on the fly. Surely such an init would be very helpful to Powerbook owners who want to do MIDI... I cannot imagine why it is not possible to do, unless it requires Apple to divluge some secret. And if that is the case, the surely APPLE could write the init. (Unless Apple brings out new models so fast these days that even THEY don't know how they work). Scott Petrack
I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few  questions about Windows for Workgroups. I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1). I am considering moving all our machines to W4WG. Q1:  How much conventional ram does W4WG use over and above the      driver for the network card? Q2:  If I have a Novell NE2000 card, are the LSL and IPX drivers      still needed? Q3:  Does W4WG do a license check over the network to ensure each      not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy      of W4WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. Returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies.) Q4:  If you buy the upgrade to Windows 3.1 for W4WG does it replace      all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current      Win 3.1 files? Q5:  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have      any troubles with the W4WG machines? When I started this message, I was going to ask only 2 questions but I got carried away. I'll stop now ;-). I look forward to your replies. Al -- 
I believe it goes or will go: 680060 powerPC Pentium 680040 486 680030 386 680020 286=680000 In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was  slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel. But, this is using a system designed  for the 030. So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie  quadra) would do better. So overall I'd figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.     Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system  at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the  speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060. I think  it laps the pentium. pro-life pro-women --   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=
I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine, but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup. The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0 The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave. When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.   Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I would not even know how to do that. Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number for Western Digital might just do as good! swood --         Hunting over in Michigan?

>	I am looking for any information about the Sigma Designs >	double up board.  All I can figure out is that it is a >	hardware compression board that works with AutoDoubler, but >	I am not sure about this.  Also how much would one cost? I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.) Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed. Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed. Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since they're being so stinky.

I'm considering adding a floptical drive to my current system. What I would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for their quality and performance. My preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both 800k and 1.4k floppies, but handling 800k floppies is not a necessity. So far, I only know a bit about the Iomega floptical and the Infinity floptical drives.  Are there any comments/recommendations for either of these? Are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where can they be purchased (i.e. which mail order places, etc). Thanks in advance. ----

Sorry about that - don't want to alarm anyone... I don't think there is any correlation between the crashes and PCTools. I reinstalled Ami Pro, and ran compress again, with no problems. I think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had 0 bytes (!) left while FTPing, although I would think it wouldn't matter since Ami Pro wasn't running at the time, and I made space available immediately anyways. But, whatever, the cause, it is working now. 				-Derek

I have a Lightening Scan Pro 256 hand scanner.  It came with scanning/editing software, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al.  The scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly accurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale.  It also has dithered and line art settings when grayscale isn't desired.  Great scanning software, easy to use.  I frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image in the note.  Hope this helps!
Hi,  I have a simple question. Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME window without a title bar; ie 	(WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME) & ~WS_CAPTION  I don't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar. I have another question: I have a overlapped window(say V) which has few child windows (a,b,c, etc) The window shows up with all it's children fine. Now, I create another  child(t) with a WS_THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of it's siblings. Style WS_THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it. How do I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings. I used SetWindowPos() and BringWindowToTop() without success. What's happening is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go, it goes behild it's siblings. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Manu

It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....

I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mouse.com 8.00 (was using 8.20  I think, but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better).  Vertical motion  is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click  on something because my mouse jumps around.  I can be moving the mouse to  the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly  for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump  again (maybe this time to the left about .5 inch!).  This is crazy!  I have  never had so much trouble with a mouse before.  Anyone have any solutions?

Fellow netters, I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has one.  I have my eye on two choices. software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also. Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE. I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).   Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy? If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. - Kevin Harter
I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU  cooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough  to dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU cooler back on.  So far so good. Have others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case? --

THe best sound conversion program I've ever seen is SoundTool, which is shareware from Germany.  I found a copy somewhere in wuarchive.wustl.edu a long time ago, but I don't know offhand what directory it was under.  It's GREAT at converting files of all types, including Mac, NExT, Sun, and various PC formats... It's also a great player and editor, with various special effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to shame.  It requires a driver for various sound cards... The only builtin one is for the pc speaker (and even that sounds pretty good), but if you're just using it to convert things, you can convert them in SoundTool and then play them in Sound Recorder. Give it a try! Bret -- 
A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation. Once the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC. Unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of SPSS left: when I run something like "Write" and go to embed an object then "SPSS Chart" appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all the obvious "INI" files without success. The next thing I tried was looking for the string "SPSS Chart" in every file in the  Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel inclined to edit it. I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.

I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0 (a wonderful interactive conferencing program, by the way).  I'm  running OpenWindows 3.0 on a SPARC 1+ under OS 4.1.3.  I have the following defaults in my .Xdefaults file (among many others):   wscrawl.telePointerName:	Kevin   wscrawl.syncScrollbars:		True   wscrawl.continuousTelePointer:	True   wscrawl.showPointerCoordinates:	False   wscrawl*background:		LightBlue   wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow   wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	Blue   wscrawl*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer Naturally, I exited the server and restarted it after adding those lines to .Xdefaults . If I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.):   xrdb -m .Xdefaults and then start up wscrawl, then all those defaults are used properly.  Wonderful, yes?  Except that I can't get them to be operative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned xrdb command.  If I try:   xrdb .Xdefaults the defaults "won't take." So, I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from:   xrdb  $HOME/.Xdefaults to:   xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults No go.  So I tried adding in:   xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  Still no go. Any notions what gives?

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me! Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)? All help appreciated...thanks! Derek ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after starting life as a 512k way back in 1985.  sooo, i'm in the market for a new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be... i'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer: * does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook introductions are expected?  i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an appearence "this summer" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i don't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had more info... * has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the ones the duo's just went through recently? * what's the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing a 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have a feel for how much "better" the display is (yea, it looks great in the store, but is that all "wow" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize this is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful). * how well does hellcats perform?  ;) thanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a summary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the corner... :( ) -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies."  - F.

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems. Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself. None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by "holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me. Beyond this Apple suggest that " you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem. Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome, particularly Apple Duo engineers :-) cheers brucet --  ***complex problems have straight forward, easy to understand wrong answers***

The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup.

The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows: 1) Use "twm" or "mwm" rather than "olwm" 3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed. This is obviously working around some bug somewhere. Thanks -- Chris Ho-Stuart
>>you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational >>prices.  I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices! I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard number (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT EMPTOR. However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist - maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remains to be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out an educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!

Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB, I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.] He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number but I can find out.) Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave). The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations: controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others. Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for "C: drive" and "D: drive" setup info rather than "drive 1" and "drive 2" like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things? So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost! Many, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help! --  ----------------------- William Barnes		SURAnet Operations

Hi. I am looking into buying a Floptical Drive, and was wondering what   experience people have with the drives from Iomega, PLI, MASS MicroSystems,   or Procom. These seem to be the main drives on the market. Any advice? Also, I heard about some article in MacWorld (Sep '92, I think) about   Flopticals. Could someone post a summary, if they have it? Thanks in advance.

The --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files on the floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't already on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives) get copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive). If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd those files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!) Generally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair shop (though there are/have been DIY guides). +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  Nick FitzGerald, PC Applications Consultant, CSC, Uni of Canterbury, N.Z.

There is no Open entry on the File menu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor. I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice multi-file replacement for Notepad.

Is anybody getting throughput anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.  These drives are 1:1 (non-interleaved), aren't they? Here are the rates I get: 1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector                     blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)                      8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec 2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly                      so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)                      8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec 3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)                      8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter, through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see anything like "after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host" (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual:   "Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of    3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum."  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec    maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87    sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)   "Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected    'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of    data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance."  (I take    this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)   "For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer    RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface    IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,    while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess you could call that a cache :-|). So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec??? Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?

Ok, I have a problem that I thought you guys/gals might know about.... I'm running a 286dx-25 with a 85mb hdd.  I also have windows 3.1, but hardly any dos application will run out it.  Also, when I do a "mem" command, it says that I have used up 58kb out of 640kb of conventional memory, zero from upper level memory, and all 385kb of my ems memory. And to top it off, I can't load any device drivers into upper memory. Do I just need more memory?  Also, why would it use up ems memory instead of upper memory? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bill Scrivener                    |    "It's not the first time that you Texas A&M University              |     sleep with a woman that matters, College Station, Texas            |     but the first time ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.     Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.     It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then "maps" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can "cd" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.    My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!   So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-) 					John --  John Gayman, WA3WBU  UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john

I believe it is the best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800 upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????   The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal clock speed to 16MHz.  That may not seem like much but it also speeds up SCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm. Check it out. David Lau
>As I said "I know a multisession CD-ROM is necessary if you do more photos..." >BUT what if it is just a writable CD-ROM drive and do a second "session" >do you need one for that too? If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever. Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.

I have an SE/30 with a 80 meg HD which dates back to April 1989.  When I originally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive. Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given the "no disk to boot from" icon.  However, upon turing the computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.   Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot  button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power off and on always works. This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot. Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how it can be fixed? I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to  "come up to speed" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before  trying to access the HD? Thanks! Altan J. Stalker Indiana University Computer Science Dept.
  I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a  NuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color  is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan rate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it can go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a software control panel.   This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw  calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing up the mac processor for other tasks.    The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night was $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just over a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the original manuals.   Hurry! Chris Magnuson Hewlett-Packard Company (719) 590-2963

Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max. Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?

Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence? What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost? >The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling >prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which >in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its >cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the >the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost} The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to come down in price. I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

Hello, I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded from ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/sounds directory.  It's called drum.zip.   I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed.  When I try to run the drum program, it reports that a MIDI device is not installed, however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it is installed.   Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program will work with my setup?  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a metronome.  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that are circulating around out there.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Terry

I am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and I have a few question about Microsoft's Office Pack.   1)  I was wondering, are the programs that are packaged with the Office Pack--WinWord, Power Point, Excel, and ccMail--complete and the latest addition? 2) Are the programs "hobbled" in any way?  3) Can we update single programs at a latter date ( i.e. from Excel 4.0 to Excel 5) ? 4) Do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation? 5) Is there anything that I should be aware of that makes the Office Package less of deal that it seems? Sorry if I seem skeptical put the price for the Office Package--$439.39 on the street--sounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first computer and software.  But all four complete programs for less than $450 makes me just a little suspicious.  Maybe its just me.

(From the Windows Resource Toolkit (for Win4Workgroups)), add an entry to your "system.ini" file under the [NonWindowsApp] section:     CommandEnvSize=NNNN "This sets the COMMAND.COM env size, where NNNN must either be 0 or between 160 and 32768.  A value of 0 disables the setting.  If this value is too small or too big, it is rounded up to 160 or down to 32768. If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment, this setting is disabled, as if it were 0.  If you specify the environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM, the PIF setting overrides this setting.  The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlier than 3.2.  Otherwise, the default value is the /e: option in the SHELL= command in CONFIG.SYS.  To set this value, you must edit your SYSTEM.INI [and reboot]." I have used this entry, as well as relied on the default /e: from the CONFIG.SYS shell= line, and both give larger environments.  If you don't use one of these, then the environment passed by windows to each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment _variables_ present when windows was started.  (No matter how big the DOS env was, when windows starts, it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes.)  This should allow your batch file to run, but your mileage may vary. -- Aspen Technology Group               UUCP:   {uunet}!csn!atglab!jls PO Box 673, Ft. Collins, CO 80522    Voice:  (303) 484-1488
   [part of posting removed]    * the Sony CPD-1304 has better video circuitry than either of the    other two monitors.  It can display Apple 640x480, VGA 640x480, VGA    800x600 (though this has 56 Hz flicker), and Apple 832x624 (75 Hz    refresh:  no flicker at all).  It might be able to display Apple's    1024x768, but I'm not sure about this, and the pixels would be real    small anyway so it might not be that useful.    Note that with either Sony monitor, you will need the proper adapter,    which both connects the video signals properly, but also informs the    Macintosh video hardware of which display mode to use.    [part of posting removed]    --     Epistemology and Learning Group, MIT Media Lab     | Cambridge, MA 02139 USA I'm assuming that the cabling tells the Mac, at startup, what kind of monitor is connected.  Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac). If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable setting and switch automatically? Thanks, Eric

Dear All, 	I am trying to get my standard connection going with KA9Q (PA0GRI113016) and a GVC NIC-2000 ethernet card. I know that my router and modem is working because I am able to ping, finger, and even telnetd with it. 	However, after a time, it crashes randomly. Help would be greatly appreciated. 	I suspect that there is a hardware conflict in the PC.  I am running with a 386SX/33, 2 MB Ram.  The Ethernet card is configured for IRQ 5, ports 0x360-0x37F.  	Thanks in advance. I know that it's not much to go on, but I don't even know what the questions to ask are, sorry. Please send mail. Elliott
Hi,   I am trying to write an X-windows based interface that runs on top of GDB. Could  anyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to "fork" GDB off as a  subprocess ?? I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program, the  following happens : PROGRAM : 	main() 	{            int x;   	   printf("enter x : ");            scanf("%d", &x);            printf("x = .%d.\n", x );         } OUTPUT : 	The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement. When I type in a value (like 5), then all the printf's output comes out at one time. Is there any other way, besides using PIPES to do this i.e., like ioctl or something else ??

I hear that the Performa 450 is really an LCIII with an internal modem.  Can the modem part be obtained and installed in an LCIII?  It would be nice if it were actually a powerbook internal modem, but that might be too much to hope for.
I have a Sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the motherboard.  The same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?) daughterboard.  I have been using this system with a color monitor having a color "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the bwtwo1, both on the same tube.  I recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 Sun mono monitor, and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the bwtwo0.  I do not care if I loose the "back" screen on the color tube from the bwtwo1.  After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if this is possible.  Has anybody sucessfuly done this before?   --Matthew

This is > not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example. To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows: A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national Instruments, at the same sample rate. D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of the 4 output channels has its own converter. The price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface board (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is $2695. Rather steep.

	Hi. I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager place the window where the create window command tells it, regardless of what it may think is right. (my application has reason to know better) 	I don't want to set the override-redirect because I do want all the embellishments that the window manager gives, I just want the wm to accept my choice of location. 	I've tried twm, tvtwm and mwm and they are all uncooperative. 	Thanks, 	-- Ethan

I would tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard. Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the SVGA card/Monitor.

I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip). When xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if xlock is NOT running.  No other processes seem to affect my runtimes, yet this is very consistent! Any explanations, real or imagined :) thanx

According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide, one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So a "hourglass" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a "caution" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a "crosswire" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know. The topics on "busy cursors" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'None'. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Hans Geurtsen                       Phone: (31) (0) 8385 - 33157                                            NL-3905 TH  Veenendaal

EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth >investing thousands of dollars (e.g. a new pc's worth of money ) in . Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus. (ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow) Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when compared to IDE? >You didn't read to carefully.

I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed. >On mine, for one thing.  SCSI blows IDE out of the water, hands down.  If >IDE has better throughput, why isn't it used on workstations and file >servers?   IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms. Is there any argument that  IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)? >: Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive >: controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do >: at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence? >: What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost? > >No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives >at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly. If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives  at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?

A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers? >No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because >nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: >easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or >Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice. So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type, considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice. >: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented >: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better >: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when >: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive. > >On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive. But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for  many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size  and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard  x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,  bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)  may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different  line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of  distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in  the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek  alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts  can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device  drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile  format and renderer.  The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.  The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly  granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without  consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT  object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it  is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely  available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed  somewhere in the documentation for the package.  We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of  user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any  published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,  which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that  as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the  kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest  in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only  afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on  those which help us get our work done.  PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically  without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub  routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any  modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the  header file "plplot.h"; see the documentation for more details.  The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of  several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex  plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to  the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained  there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.    At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: 	 Unix:	SunOS 		 A/IX  		 HP-UX 		 Unicos 		 DG/UX 		 Ultrix 		 SysV 		 Linux 	 Amiga/Exec 	 MS-DOS 	 OS/2 	 NeXT  For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:   - appendices to the PLPLOT manual   - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

Hi there, Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C650 regarding fpu?  In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C650 has the message "fpu: optional".  I know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80 configuration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list? I'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not. Why say "optional" if it's built in? Please, anybody help me understand this game. Regards, Thian.

: > My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state : > of CapsLock and/or NumLock is? : Alright.  Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and : found what I was looking for. : ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one : for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies : from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and : which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask). : eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris : 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an : unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any : given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance. You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are  used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock modifier). I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any. X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well.  Hope that helps, Dave Lapp Standard Disclaimer etc...
Hi, I've got a Multi I/O card (IDE controller + serial/parallel interface) and two floppy drives (5 1/4, 3 1/2) and a Quantum ProDrive 80AT connected to it. I was able to format the hard disk, but I could not boot from it. I can boot from drive A: (which disk drive does not matter) but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch, the LED of drive A: continues to glow, and the hard disk is not accessed at all. I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi I/o card or floppy disk drive settings (jumper configuration?) Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it.

> My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ 5, which is > unreserved in contemporary computers (using IRQ 5 for the > drives went out with the XT architechture ... ) Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt. On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1, a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect) that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root window.  Contact HP support and see whether VUE can support coloured bitmap format such as xpm, if they cant then they probably create all their coloured backdrops inside the code. --                             Cambridge      Bang:     ...!uunet!ixi!guy                             CB4 4ZR, UK    Tel:      +44 223 236 555

I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions. I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine. Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++: - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC). - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references). I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. --        If these were my employer's opinions, I wouldn't be posting them. ###############################################################################   "Whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously  # R.

Very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is. 	From what I've seen, the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz intelligent bus (ie, bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like, not jumpers...)  Hopefully it'll get somewhere up there with the AMIGA  Zorro III bus.... 	VL Bus is a bit too much of a hack for my liking... 	Toodlepip! 	Marc 'em.

While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts, I found a half-size board that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and has a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connector and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each, two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC and ran Advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions each time, but the system did not recognise a comm port. Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it? I could use another comm port if it's free. Bryan

A couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerning communicating between VB and MSACCESS using DDE. The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems. 1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB? 2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.    The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends. Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access? Bob

>   [Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated] >   >8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec. >   If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE >   come from? Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s, which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states). --  OS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...
I would be grateful to anyone who knows about an X-windows application that would emulate HP 2623A graphics in a manner similar to the way TEK graphics windows are implemented in xterm. Thanks for you help.

I have  a strange piece of equipment to unload. It is a Ether+ SCSI interface. Apparently, it can be plugged into a SCSI port and from there to an ethernet. That way you save a slot. Nifty. Well, I assume you people know more about it, so, judging by the $350 price tag new, I'll ask, say, $75? Anybody interested?

The document (which I got from the 2/10/93 announcement at our Apple office) states the drive kit and bezel kits are separate items and the bezel kit has an SRP of $149 fro the C650. The external unit may be a better deal after all.   -- disclaimer: the preceding represent my personal opinions and do not reflect the opinions, policies, or practices of my employer
Is anyone out there using a greyscale handscanner. I'm thinking about buying one. Is the inexpensive Logitech pretty good. I don't need super high quality scans- but want it to be worth the $$$$. Thanks in advance- Mike Charles
Hi all,       I'm looking for some info regarding an old pcmade by Otronics (or maybe Oltronics) called the Attache.  This little beauty is an 8088 / Z80 luggable with a 4 or 5 inch screen (monochrome CGA) and 2 360 floppies.       For serial ports it has 2 DB-15 connectors (one is labled 'printer') and I can't figure out the pinouts for them.  I also don't know if they  are standard com ports addressable as COM1 and COM2.  I have figured out  that they'll only work with DOS 2.something.            If anyone can give me some pointers on this one, I'd be most  appreciative.  Please reply via email, as I can't keep up with news  lately.  (Finals are coming up you know :( ) Thanks much,
>Not necessarily a thrid-party adapter; Apple does manufacture transceivers >for thinWire and 10BaseT (twisted pair) cable media, as well as an AUI >(Attachment Unit Interface) transciever. They run at ~$100 each. If you use >thinWire or 10BaseT, you'll probably also need terminators (Apple's >transceivers are self-terminated, if I remember correctly, but I have no >idea about DECs).  The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple. >    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only >(can't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133), so your best bet That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations. My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is: (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts). (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use "Ethernet". (3) On the DECstation side, you will need:     - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.     - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.       Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the       DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable       (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).     - get a 25ohm terminator. Your two-machine network will look like this:        ##T----------------------------------------------[]       +-----+                                           |       |     |                                           |       +-----+                                         +-----+                                                       |     |                                                       +-----+     DECstation                                        Centris      5000/200                                           650                               OR        ##T----------------------------------------------[]         {=}                                             |       +-----+                                           |       |     |                                         +-----+       +-----+                                         |     |                                                       +-----+     DECstation                                        Centris 5000/25,125,133,240                                     650              ##    -> 25ohm terminator    T     -> T connector    ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)    {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter    []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)    |    | Andy --  Computing Coordinator                   Ontario, Canada.

You're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings I've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are no, repeat no, internal modems for the Duo besides the Express Modem... at _any_ speed.  Something having to do with the modem using the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing details on the architecture, or something.  I'm vague on the details, but the gist was that there are going to be no third-party internal Duo modems.  If I'm wrong, somebody please correct me on this.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

Hi,   Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.   I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect") terminology! is started by xdm.   i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to      display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!      The setup is as follows:         lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc         ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc                                     tvtwm      There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home      directory.      The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm      login window as expected - very nice!      Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the      tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an      xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as      expected.      The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window      and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the      the users session startup?  ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised      and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.      ie: real key       key shown on screen          ------------   -------------------          hash           back slash          tilde          pipe          double quote   at symbol          pound          hash          cursor key     not recognised      This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have      installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and      termcap as they seemed more uptodate.      Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as      expected!   Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after updating the datastructures though...  -Rob

With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to "think" while disk operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU. So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do. One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes, with no DMA. --  OS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...

This is what all this is about.  Do you >get more performance for the money. Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s  asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit  hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1  devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst >IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                           Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower  {Range 0-5MB/s} >ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions) One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.  Its PROPER meaning is "The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2" Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: (My comments in {}) PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI, {This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..." {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} "Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE..." or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} "Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE..." NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity. SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers  are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)} If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking  about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2} IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

The short answer seems to be: "I don't". The particular package (wscrawl) seems to reset *all* its defaults if *any* of them are missing from the .Xdefaults file.  Once I added the missing ones to the .Xdefaults file, the problem goes away. -Kevin --  Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp.

OK..... thanks to all of you who responded to my post. here's the "official" response from orchid.. Orchid is aware of the problem, the new rev of the board (rev d) SHOULD         (not would) take care of the problem. production was scheduled to start on april 15, I have no confirmation that production did start on this day just the word of the tech on the other line. now the flame...... you would think a company like Orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs.  very poor tech support (the first 2 times I called I must have spoke with the janitor because they where talking craziness) the last time I talked to a tech  named "paul" and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on. until these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy or recommend orchid products. flame off..... again thanks to all of you who answered my post.

it doesnt matter what window mgr you running under, you can use the X routine: 	XIconfiyWindow(display, w, screen_number) 		Display *display; 		Window w; 		int screen_number; as in 	XiconifyWindow( XtDisplay(w), XtWindow(w), 0); does that perform what you want??

>>Is there anyway to use X Windows over an async line?  Clearly you could use >                                x >It is X window. No, it isn't.  It is the "X Window System", or "X11", or "X" or any of a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact, doing "man X" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:      The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used      when referring to this software:                                   X                            X Window System                              X Version 11                      X Window System, Version 11                                  X11 There is no such thing as "X Windows" or "X Window", despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have  to say? With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both  GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)   NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available. X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.  It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various  sorts of hardware.

We here at Utah State University Cooperative Extension have been using W4Wg for a while now.  We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.   There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying "Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I am looking vigorously for a better Idea.   If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please drop me a note - anyone.

Help.... I need to implement COM3 and COM4 on a board that I'm designing and I'm finding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of COM3 and COM4. I have the IO adresses and the fact that COM3 shares IRQ4 with COM1 and COM4 shares IRQ3 with COM2, except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not clear especially if the existing COM1/2 does not allow IRQ sharing. Does the standard??? allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how. Please answer by email to :- thanks in advance Neil Watkinson.

I started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies. The summary: CTX 14": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.   Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning   (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc. I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days.  It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly, a Trinitron (say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range. send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it, but has good potential. Chris

[much discussion about switching 5.25" and 3.5" drives removed] Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II (available via anonymous FTP at many major sites), or FDFORMAT (also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format 5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5"HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken MeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25" disks onto 3.5" disks or vice versa...  I use this techniques with "NON-DOS" self-booting  game disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works...  Another program named Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II or FDFormat installed....  Some disks that won't DISKCOPY properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format... At least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS  deficiency, eh?  -- [====Disclaimer--If you believe any of this, check your head!====] ------------------------------------------------------------------ Nuke the Whales!

Is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle a compressed IDE drive without screwwing it up? Need to document occasional failures in reading/writing, check overall integrity of disk's hardware and sectors. I believe that all of my problems with DOS/Windows can be isolated to my drive.  Getting occasional corrupted files, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off. Had these problems under DOS 5.  Only with drive C. Drive D may have had one failure, but that file was under the control of Win/Winword on drive C. All utilities available to me report no problems. DOS, NDD (NU4.5).  Another symptom, SD took forever on C, and kicked me out with a suspension till NDD run 6 to 8 times.

Hi All! I tried to run SoftPC, a PC emulation software program, installed on a Silicon  Graphics workstation from a Human Design System (HDS) X terminal, and  everything went fine, except the fonts could NOT be converted from one type  of format to the other - HDS uses different font format from SGI worksation. So, I have the following questions: 1. How do you resolve different font formats from different machines? 2. Is there a program to convert one type of font format to another?

ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB. I was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows. but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA, especially this new Strike Commander. ;-) this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench). my winmark was 6.35 million, i think. so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully can perform approx same w/ my current VRAM in windows and also can perform DOS' VGA preferably >30fps. i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it in csipg and it looked that SpeedStar 24X and Orchid Prodesigner 2d-s ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard. both can give >30fps in DOS' VGA w/ 486dx2/66. Does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor type ? which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)? any other card recommendation is welcomed too. also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? ;-) thanks in advance, folks! ===Martin

       [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of        /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have        to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string        instead of using convenient octal sequences.] Bad idea. using /usr/5bin/echo is slower than the built-in echo. This is what I do. It does execute `hostname` once per shell window, and does read in one extra file. But manipluating the titles does not require executing extra programs.

Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is no "option" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs: there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA). And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040. It's not an "option."     Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink. -Hades

Facts: ===== - A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive. - Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a - When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable. My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks. I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive. Install will proceed "successfully", but when I try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware. Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit).  Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors. Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?  So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured? 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides. Thanks for your time. Apology: ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting my net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting.

I know this is probably a FAQ, but... I installed the s/w for my ATI graphics card, and it bashed my Windows logo files.  When I start Windows now, it has the 3.0 logo instead of the 3.1 logo. I thought the files that controlled this were \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VGALOGO.RLE \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VGALOGO.LGO	 I restored these files, but it didn't change the logo.  Anyone know what the correct files are? Thanks. -- 
  Hi All,   I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards, eg. one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters, et.c.   Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some "non-trivial" data to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off, typeamatic specs.) from inside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above, which wouldn't look too neat, besides, what would one do from an XT?)   Great thanks in advance, Andrew. 
This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron (formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard. I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company. I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc. Thanks very much in advance for any information. -- Mohammad Al-Ansari

I have a Centris 610 & want to get an IBM machine as well. To save space on my desk, I would like to use one monitor for both, with a switch-box. Does anyone know of a way to do this?
Hello, I already tried our national news group without success. I tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PC with a normal TEAC drive. I already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shorted pin 6 (5.25"/3.5" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins 8, 26, 28, 30, and 34. The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD, but the FD's light stays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk, but I can't access it. The TEAC works fine in a normal PC. Are there any points I missed? Thank you. 	Volkmar ---

Howdy We have been having a real problem with an AST 386sx/16 machine with 4mb of RAM.  We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don't think  Paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok (windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell network (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program will not load in 386 enchanted mode.  The thermometer bar goes to 60% and we then either get a 'invalid command.com' or a windows nastygram talking about an illegal instruction.  I've checked out the command.com thing, but as a long-time C programmer, I've crashed my share of machines with pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-) Anyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.  We also have quattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior.  Spent about 2 hours with Borland's tech people, with no avail.  The guy I talked to a microsoft didn't want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly. Somewhat disappointing, really.  I expected more from Microsoft.  You'd think with all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all the possible problems, but I guess not... Microsoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing UAE and General Protection faults (sorry, I can't fax anything out of here so please don't ask, try Microsoft), which we tried.  We did *everything* they said, and still no luck. So.  If you can help, please mail me.  This problem is driving us nuts. I will greatly appreciate any information anyone can pass on.

>Its not a difficult operation-- the cables and such are standard, >except for SCSI ID.  SCSI ID is usually three jumper pads-- labelled >A0-A2 on Quantums. I am trying to put a 40MB drive from my LC into a case.  It is a Conner CP3040A.  I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers. Is anyone familiar with this drive? At the end of the drive (oposite the 50 pin pibbon connector), there are eleven pins which look like this:         o o o o o   o   1           o o o o   o   2          L5  CR12   C37 where the "o" are pins, and the "L5 CR12 C37" represent some of the silk screen notation near these pins. Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked E1,E2,E3,E4 on the silk screen. Does anyone know where the SCSI ID A0,A1,A2 pins are, and where the drive activity light LED should be plugged into? 		-allan -- 
well people, I can only recomend the non-flat-screen, no-hype,  no-nonsense NEC 3DS that I have, and PLUS, it has the ADVANTAGE of NOT having one of those new flat screen tubes which are oversensitive and fragile and break often! this is a 15'' heavy-duty rugged set for those who insist on well-proven reliable technologies! jim

All other uses must receive prior permission in writing  Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel. X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program. X X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from X    a short example! X---author--- Xname:	Landon Curt Noll Xorg:	IOCCC Judging Group Xaddr:	Toad Hall X	PO Box 170608 X	San Francisco, California X	94117-0608 X	USA Xanon:	n X---author--- Xname:	Larry Bassel Xorg:	IOCCC Judging Group Xaddr:	Toad Hall X	PO Box 170608 X	San Francisco, California X	94117-0608 X	USA Xemail:	hoptoad!sun!lab Xanon:	n X---info--- Xbegin 444 info.file XM=&EO;B!O<B!N;VXM<')O9FET('5S92!I<PIG<F%N=&5D('!R;W9I9&5D('1H X` Xend X---build--- Xbegin 444 build X` Xend X---program--- Xbegin 444 prog.c X` Xend X---end--- X X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y" X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.

Are there any Workspace Managers out there for Windows 3.1 ? By a Workspace Manager, I mean something like the HP APOLLO Workstations have - multiple workspaces under X.  There is a window at the bottom of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces. It overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one screen.  Instead, you can spread them amongst different workspaces which act like independent screens, and you can flick between them. Thanks in advance.
Dear friend,   The RISC means "reduced instruction set computer". The RISC usually has  small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase  the clock rate to have a high performance. You can read some books about computer architecture for more information about RISC.

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .   one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.   omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.   ***************************************************************** *  Tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath,        * *  From the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death,       * *  From the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud,          * *  O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?                 * *                                                 -William Knox * ***************************************************************** *****************************************************************

Hello, I have a 386sx25 notebook with windows 3.1 running fine. WINWORD 2.0 and  QUATTRO-PRO for windows also work fine when no virtual memory is used.  Switching on the virtual memory option these programs (probably others too)  don't work, the system crashes. The same programs work well with arbitrary  virtual memory on two other desktop PC's. What am I doing wrong? If you can help, please mail to me directly, if possible. Thank you very much in advance.

	I'm looking for a program that will let me use a windows common dialog box to select a file to use when running a DOS app. 	Basically, I have several DOS apps that I use now and then with different files.  They all accept a file as a command line  parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type  in the file name).   Problems are: 	1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager. 	     and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried  several directory levels deep. 	If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it. Thanks, Tim --  	The Net isn't organized enough to be considered an anarchy

Just my luck.  I did however call my local Apple dealer and he said that the he thinks the serial numbers of the machines that are covered begin with either 70 or 53-56, and maybe one other.

I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application could be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an  XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe). Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program? Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me with XOpenWindow? I have never used GL before, but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also, most of the GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this true? Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL? Environment:      AIXwindows X11R4      Motif 1.1      GL is available      AIX Sys V 3.2      IBM RS/6000 360 Thanks in advance.

Hi! I'd like to switch my floppy drives so that my 3.5" b: drive becomes a:, while my 5.25" a: becomes b:. I'm having a few problems, though.

However, the drives do not operate correctly in this configuration. From the C:> prompt, if  I type a:, the 5.25" drive light comes on; if I type b:, both the light for the 5.25" and 3.5" drives come on.

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were: 	1) Clients written with logic like the following: 	    if (DefaultDepth() != 1) 		/* Assume default depth is 8bit */ 	   These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window 	   to run correctly. 	2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just 	   outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a 	   dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps 	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but 	   many clients don't bother to check, they just start 	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you. Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing. -- 		Evans & Sutherland

Free options 	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2. 	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will 	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86 	is listed below. 	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was 	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards. 	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4, 	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you 	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it? 3. What is XFree86?    XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:     1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.    The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):     1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two        headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).        Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.    Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat. 4. What OSs are supported?     XFree86 supports: 	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2 	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC 	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2 	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1 	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active 	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet, 	but anyone should feel free to submit patches. 	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to 5. What video hardware is supported?    At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets: 	Tseng ET4000 	Tseng ET3000 	Paradise PVGA1 	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of 		the PVGA1, and use its driver) 	Genoa GVGA 	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000 	ATI 18800, 28800 	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, 	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in 	256 color mode. 	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of 	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the 	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome 	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k. 	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to 	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To 	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel 	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are 	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how 	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such 	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with 	future XFree86 releases. 	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86, 	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the 	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not 	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details. 	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond 	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions 	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). 	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it. 	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA 	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the 	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It 	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset 	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot 	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested 	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not 	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 	working fine on them. 6. What about accelerated boards? 	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards 	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available 	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4). 	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact 7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes? 	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory 	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- 	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each 	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame- 	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled 	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code 	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure). 	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer 	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this, 	but nothing is yet available from the project. 8. What other hardware or software requirements are there? 	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run 	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum. 	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending 	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). 	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will 	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable  	lower bound. 9. Where can I get source for XFree86? 	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22 	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from: 		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86) 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86) 		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86) 	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP) 	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information 	on which files you need to get to build your distribution. 10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86? 	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from: 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries 			under /XFree86/SVR4 		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/ISC 		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries 			under /pub/linux/packages/X11 		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries 			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries 			under /i386 	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may 	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will 	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take 	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were 	made when building the distribution. IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86? 11. Installation directories 	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot 	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include 	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}. 	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified 	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is 	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed 	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation. 12. Configuration files 	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup. 	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in 	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions. 13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes 	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings. 	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and 	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is 	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on 	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated 	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the 	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to 	David for inclusion in the database. 	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file  	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. 	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use 	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information 	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database. 	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and 	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot 	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from 	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The 	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. 	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your 	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up 	      starting the server in the future. 14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit 	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to 	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is 	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit. V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86? 	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755). 15. SVR4 	Why won't my xterm run properly? 	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define 	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run. 	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no' 	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping 	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be 	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap. 16. SVR3 	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running. 17. 386BSD 	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD. 	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey 	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites: 	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 18. Linux 	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc 	jump libraries installed. 	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root. 	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to 	run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes 	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files 	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the 	-pn argument to X386. 	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major 	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not 	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit 	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but 	startx won't. 	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with 	a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &". 	For more detailed information, please read the file README present 	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu. 19. Mach 	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach. VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source? 	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is 	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs. 	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86. VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86? 20. BSD compatibility library 	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc. 	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a 	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), 	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include 	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro 	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are 	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these 	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a 21. ANSICCOPTIONS 	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the 	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite 	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see 	something like 		CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings" 	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put 		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" 	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of 		ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi" 		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" 	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is: 		ANSICCOPTIONS= 	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death 	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because 	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must 	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition. XFree86 Contact Information     Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86     Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of: 	The original "gang of four": 	Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems: 	-------------------------------------------------- Thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates). --  Engineering Computing Facility      uucp:   uunet!utai!ecf!steve University of Toronto               phone:  (416) 978-5898

(The newest is the T9000 which kicks anyone's butt :)... haven't seen them used much though). Anyway, to respond, I think the Pentium (CISC) is better than the more advanced RISC (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the same "performance" as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here, performance is the weird Specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what I *heard* - the Alpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*). and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0). If you can make a "CISC" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast) with the ideas behind the "RISC" ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC... If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively speaking). Now I may sound like I like intel, but I'll have to say that the P5 is some real kick butt pile of Si and SiO2... But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the 68K line... or I'm gonna start crying... brian ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brian "Hojo" Lee       | "Hey, excuse me miss, could I have a .GIF of you?" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I was told that my last message came through without anything in it, so I'll try again. I have a Leading Edge 386SX 16 with a flaky motherboard and a friend game me one to replace it, but he didn't have any docs for the  mother board.  It's a CHEERTRON board with Award bios and has a    sticker on it that says VI 1   T1 3  T2 3  on it.  I can tell what most of the switches on the blue blocks mean.  except FDC and SH, but I have no idea about all the jumpers.  I've replaced hard drives and modems and installed math co-processes, but this is a bit out of my league and without the docs, I'm really lost. If anyone could give me some help on this, I'd really appreciate it.  I don't get on news regularly, so if you can help, please Thanks. -- Shirl  
Please excuse and redirect me if this has already been answered, but is there a small utility that switches the functionality of the caps-lock key and the ctrl key on the powerbook keyboard?  I use the ctrl key far more than caps-lock, so it would be more convenient and comfortable. Thank you for any help, Scott Farrar

Hello all! For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi. With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear. But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some "spiky" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one. I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference? I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can, at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC 3D.

The alternative approach (to CISC),  which has been adopted by many in  Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as  "Simpler is Faster"; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing  the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be  designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more  instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,  faster design.  A typical RISC processor will:     o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);     o perform all data operations on registers;     o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');     o only allow load & store operations to access memory;     o only use a few instruction formats;     o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating). If the odds are a million to one against something occurring, chances are 50-50 it will.

I don't know if this is an obvious question, but can any of the current  batch of windows accelerator cards (diamond etc) be used to drive a monitor  which has RGB and horizontal and vertical sync ( 5 BNC jacks altogether)  connectors out the back??

I have noticed in FrameMaker 3.1X on both the SGI and SUN platforms that certain dialogs, such as "Column Layout..." for example, respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is NOT in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is POINTER. How is this done? I would like to emulate this behavior in my application. It seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action, the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus. Alternatively, I'm open to any suggestions as to what is the "right" way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear, particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus policy is pointer.

store and reply of mouse and keyboard events -------------------------------------------- To produce regression tests or automatic demo's we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events produced by a user. It should be possible to filter the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue an to store them in a file. This sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given  to the server's queue as if a user is working. 1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all    mouse and keyboard events (where)? 2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?    In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).    Where can we catch all events coming from a given    server.    If this is not possible, can we catch all events given    to a certain client and how ?     3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?    Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages    all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ? Thanks in advance Ron.

 We've developed a number of applications using DevGuide and found it to  be a very useful tool. I've been impressed with the level of integration it affords using the connection editor. I love the general ease of use.    I talked with Tali Aben at Sun today about DevGuide + Motif. She was very helpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next version of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentioned I was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional comments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into.     Send your comments/wish-list, raving, et. al. about DevGuide to:  Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of this and computers may have a future.  Frankly, I like the idea that it will offer some migration capability to DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability, pointed out in March's  SunExpert magazine.   Technology works, we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide. Price is  outstanding. 
I need to write an application which does annotation notes on existing documents.  The annotation could be done several times by different people.  The idea is something like having several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other so that the user can see through all of them.  I've seen something like this being done by the oclock client. Could someone please tell me how to do it in Xt? Thank you very much.

Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not   really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting   (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come   out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for   all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.   Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.   Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely   adopted. 				Regards, 					Richard Gooch....

Hello, 	I'm having problems printing SPANISH characters with WFW2.  I was using the Celtic True type which has the accented characters, and used insert symbol to put in in the document.  However, when I put it in the doc, I get a big square character, and then it prints out just the same (to my dismay, thinking that was just the way it worked). Can anyone tell me if and how they have printed Spanish characters?  I know WP 5.1 has this built-in, but I do not recall ever seeing this option on WFW2.

Anyone seen any press releases or heard any rumors of a cache card for the LCIII, now that it has the full data bus width on the PDS slot? -- 
Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI  accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache, New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously. I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive tower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto which I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two internal hard drives. It works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.

Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a "bad" experience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks. Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me "Why we never received your old chips."  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied "You mean you sent them US Mail?" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to "make it right." I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never buy another product from them again. (There - had to get that off my chest!)
Dear Folks: It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program,  Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews. Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects. Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.

Well, yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that "popular usage" is not always sufficient excuse.   In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or  mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably not.   The same is true of X.  "The X Window System", "X", "X11", and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact  that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.   As for the trade publications that promulgate things like "X Window" or "X.windows" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees,  consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by  *journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong? Popular usage is as it may be, but I for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness. >Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS >was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically >superior as well!).

HI,     Recently, when I run the Norton Disk surface test, I realize a slow down in harddisk accessing.  At begining of the test, the harddisk will be checked at the speed that usually is.  As the surface test scaned half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured.  The expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  I try to use some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the original speed after it gets over the section.  I am wondering whether it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. Anyway help or comment will be appriciate....                                                  Shane Cheney Wang

What files do I need to download for GhostScript 2.5.2?  I have never used GhostScript before, so I don't have any files for it.  What I *do* have is gs252win.zip, which I downloaded from Cica.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work on it's own, but needs some more files that I don't have.  I want to run GhostScript both in Windows 3.1 and in MS-DOS on a 386 PC (I understand there's versions for both environments).  What are all the files I need to download and where can I get them?

In PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE, and support up to 7 devices its acceptance ...has long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches." note what it does NOT site as a factor: PRICE. int eh same article the PC would will get plug and play SCSI {from the article it seems you get plug and play SCSI-1 only since SCSI-2 in FULL implimentation has TEN NOT 7 devices.} SCSI-1 intergration is sited as another part of the MicroSoft Plug and play program.

Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead of transporting through whatever client-server communications mechanism you are using. Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps? These are maintained by the server, so copying them into a window is much cheaper. Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs, or running in XSynchonize mode. --  		Evans & Sutherland

I just had an idea. I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just remembering it unconsiously, but I thought that in dialog boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or filled in a certain way. My idea: tape. You know, like putting a piece of tape over a light switch? Just an idea, if you like it, use it. -- 
Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and  Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085. I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received,  the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?

: Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing : of X/Motif applications.

Does anyone know of a program which doesn't require an X extension?  Most the the X servers we have at work have vendor extensions which we can't modify, so XTrap doesn't help up.

The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. If you don't intend to magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true 256 level gray scanner would work better for images. I've seen the ScanMan go for as little as $100 used. It is a reasonable buy at that price. Higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used flat bed scanners. Here is Seattle, the paper shows occasional good bargains in the classifieds. Used color flat beds have been seen as lows as $500 lately. Grey scale flatbeds come in around $300-$350. 
I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris. . . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions.  My PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the outside of the case.  Where do I connect this switch??  Can the computer just "tell" with internal drives?   	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I didn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's soldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems? 	One last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?   the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases).  Should I just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place? Ans are welcomed!  Thanks! Keith Moffatt

I installed Windows for Workgroups on my network and I'm having problems  mapping drives in the file-manager.

If I don't put LASTDRIVE = Z in my config.sys I can't access other W4WG  drives from the file-manager. It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE =  statement in my Config.Sys. I would appreciate any help.

However, the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3.  For example, the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a  dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview knows nothing about drag and drop. The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50, dated 5/22/90, while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says:         textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro         dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro         tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro         ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro So, does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available? I'd really like to work from the latest source if possible. Please reply by email, and I'll post a summary if there's enough  interest. --  Matt Landau			Waiting for a flash of enlightenment
Hello Everybody! I have a little question: Due to more features (PEX, Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for example Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver. X-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my question: Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free memory available to the Xserver? So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the CSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory). Please reply via e-mail, I'll summarize! Sincerly,         Matthias --      6100 Darmstadt, FRG | ZGDV, Wilhelminenstrasse 7 | Lichtenbergstrasse 73       R5 is different from R4. That's why we changed the release number :-)

Please help if you can with the following strange problem:   The Maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time to   time, for no obvious reason spin down completely (one can   tell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. DOS   reacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed or   something the like). Unfortunately, I cannot just reproduce   the error. Sometimes it occurs more often, sometimes   less. The last time it happened was when I wanted to    demonstrate some software to a colleague.     I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar   problems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealer   only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it. I   checked the other post in this group about Maxtor, and   I don't seem to be the only one who has problems. However,   no one describes the same problem, and I also have a    different configuration.   Thanx in advance for any e-mailed help.

..deleted... In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic.  XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event driven style of an application. ---     _/       _/  _/ _/     "Delta hedging a long option position also    _/           _/ _/	    generates a short gamma exposure and any return   _/_/_/_/ _/  _/ _/	    generated from delta hedging options can be thought  _/    _/ _/  _/ _/	    of as compensation for assuming gamma risk" _/_/_/_/ _/  _/ _/	    -- Radioactive investment management... whew!
Has anyone else experienced problems with windows hanging after the installation of DOS 6?  I have narrowed the problem down to EMM386. If if remove (or disable) EMM386, windows is ok.  If EMM386 is active, with NOEMS, windows hangs.  If I use AUTO with EMM386, the system hangs on bootup.

	Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two  weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store)  appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet. He wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!!  They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with!   	Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.   Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected (must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up! 	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get it swapped. 	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient. 	Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up. I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature... 	Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!
I own an 8088 640K clone which does all I want except run 1 game I want to buy.  The game says it requires a 80286 with 640K.  Game tech. support says game will run on 8088 but uses a some digitized graphics which would make it run really *slow* (it's a card game - Hoyles Classic Card Games, digitized graphics are photos artwork of game fictional card players). What can I do to speed up how this game would run, short of an 80286 motherboard upgrade.  Co-processor?  Accelerator card mimicking 80286? My 8088 can run at 10 Mhz.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The hardware will automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now.     I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great.    If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.   It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the  first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response --  especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems. Justin ---  
>Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are >inconveniently lame for making games. The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the book is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.) The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately, System 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally. >The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! >Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to >do, >but I'm going say it anyway. >Stop cheating on sound! >Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers >will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware.

I don't know about sys 7.1, but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable. Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an *undocumented* flag and modify it. Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get rid of the bugs. Any better suggestions?

After setting up Windows for using my Cirrus Logic 5426 VLB GraphicsCard It moved a normal Window from one place to another.  My Parameters where just the following : 486 DX 33 VLB  The Card is equipped with 1 MB Dram (not Vram, there are 8 sockets for Vram)  And the moving of the window just looked like it looked at a friends 386DX 25 (387DX) and an normal ISA ET4000 What I was wondering why is it not using the BITBLT  Engine which is suuposed to be on the Chip. How are the experiences here.. Have I done something wrong ? (I installed the MSWIN 3.1 MultiResolution drivers which where supplied  with the Card ?!) Would be nice if somebody could tell about his experience with this card Also if there are new(hopefully faster) drrivers around I would love to  how to get hold of them :-) (ftp or whatsoever :-) ) Gruss 	Wolfgang

This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit) to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out! I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns one slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots, as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there. My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem). If there is such an expander, does that screw up performance of everything else?  I'd hate to buy a new motherboard! :-(  -- Carl Christensen                /~~\_/~\        ,,,  Dept. of Computer Science "Curiouser and curiouser!" - LC \__/~\_/        ```  Philadelphia, PA  USA

I had a bunch of problems regarding sleep/wakeup/restart with the 230 when I first got it, both with and without the techworks ram.  Finally it "died", wouldn't start, until I  opened the docking door (which snaps open) and  the machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off.  Apple  replaced the processor board. Now,   twice the machine has frozen (no mouse action)   twice the machine has refused to wake up.  Acutally, the backlighting     came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in     (but not with a good battery).     The first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery       for ~1 minute brought the machine back.     The second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until       powered down for about 30 minutes.  The screen had what looked       like red horizontal lines accross it.

Subject: >80 col. mail messages in MS Windows editors I have a modest system of aliases/macros that enables me to download mail from a public access UNIX system to my MS-DOS box.

I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being  clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed the F1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the following line in .Xdefaults: ~Ctrl ~Shift ~Alt <Key> F1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\ I merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm which has the remapped F1 key. The problem that arises is that the  application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e> sequence, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each character being filtered or ignored. When I run xev and press the F1 key, I get the correct value showing  up in the following two key events:   KeyPress event, serial 14, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,   root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),   state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,   XLookupString gives 0 characters:  ""   KeyRelease event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,   root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104),   state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,   XLookupString gives 0 characters:  "" Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe. But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to  spit back the hex values of keyboard input, I only get <7f> <3e>. Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to the final application? Any help is greatly appreciated.

I am trying to create a simple drawing tool....        __________        |        |        |     ___|___        |_____|__|  |              |	   | 	     |_____| Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvas(see above)  one intersecting the other... Now, I would like to delete one of the rectangles. The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes. A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel  locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is  something that should be avoided. Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other rectangle too? I also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area as this degrades performance very badly... Thank you... Gopal
Window placement on screen -------------------------- I would like to configure my system (a HP UNIX) to avoid that any corner of a given window is displayed outside of the visible screen. The whole window should be visible and it should be impossible to move any window outside the visible aerea. 1. Can this be done by configuring the window manager's resources 2. Can this be done on applikation level  3. A hardcoded solution is possible, but is it possible to have a   upper limit of a given window size Thank you for information and help
Has anyone use Snooper or MacEKG or any other similar diagnostic  software.Any comparisons/reviews on these products would be very much  appreciated.

>If you get teh IIvx ->C650 upgrade, does it include a new sticker to >cover the IIvx identifier with a Centris 650 indetifier? I can't say for sure with the IIvx -> C650 upgrade, but I wondered the same thing when I ordered my LC -> LC III upgrade.  Turns out the "upgrade" is actually an entire CPU minus any disk drives.  You pull the floppy and hard drives out of the old one, stick them in the new one, and you've got an LC III. The IIvx -> C650 may be the same thing. It might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that Apple only sells Macs pre-packaged with the drives.  Of course, the price is quite a bit higher without the trade-in...

Is there a FAQ on Cyrix 486DLC? Could anyone please repost it or email to me, if I missed it? Thanks in advance.   ---   Blue Wave/QWK v2.12

Here's a good one: Does anyone know of a product that allows me to RACK MOUNT my 2CI (or maybe 650 if I blow some more money...) ??? My application is music, and would like to be able to haul it around (would probably plan to get an MO drive or something so I don't have to depend on an internal fixed hard drive - i.e., may be pretty rough on an internal HD...) I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area, if that matters. Also, anyone have any info on 650's and Midi? And, would anyone care to email me with the price they paid for their 650? Or if there's a price list FAQ, never mind... Just curious about the difference between the best retailers and the local university pricing... Thanks, Jeff Adams   
>I know of two people who have horrer stories about the DOS 6.0. >That's 100% of the people I know with DOS 6.0. Both have >had to reformat their disks and start over. 	I used the standard installation program to put MS-DOS 6.0 on my machine with Stacker 3.0 already installed.  No problems.  I kept Stacker, rather than switch. 	I am very pleased with the memory I gained since I did not have a memory manager.  I also like the multiple boot feature.
I  have one of the original Powerbook 170's (with 4Mb of Ram) and find that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work.  So, what is the best way to get the maximum RAM for this unit, and what's it going to cost me? I'm hoping I can get the latest and best info from real users by posting  to this group. Thanks in advance, --Bill
So far I have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard, but it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split. However, when I learned typing in school some years ago, I was taught to write 'b' with my right hand. Is this a difference between Danish and American typing, or what??? Thanks a lot in advance! --    Thomas Widmann                   -Lernu Esperanton-
I'm looking for a PC that is small and doesn't break apart if you drop it on the groud.  It doesn't have to have graphics, text only will do just fine. It doesn't have to be fast either, 8086 will do, I hope. But you must stand a pretty hard enviroment without breaking apart, jumnping on it or trying to use it outdoor while it is raining and so forth. I need 640Kb of memory and a convinient way of loading applications into it that I wrote myself (floppy or somekind of writeable cartridge?).  Is there a PC like that?? And where can I get more info? I know of the Atari portfolio but it can't stand the rain....

This way, if the relay breaks, my drives will still work. It works fine, but you may still need to change the CMOS before the drive switch will work correctly for some programs. rp93 -- 
I was just reading in PC Magazine that the peripherals in a PC with an ISA bus can only access 16MB of memory.  Also, that some video cards on the ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to.  So that if I wanted to put 16MB of memory on my PC, my video card wouldn't have anywhere to map it's memory to. Can someone explain this in more detail.  Is there a way around this limit. If you email me a response, I will summarize. --

I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server. The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the "happy Mac face" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable. It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year). Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables. Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution? Thanks a lot.    E. --  Eric Behr, Illinois State University, Mathematics Department

In TeleUSE you can call any C++ method from a "D" module.  What you can do then is to use the "D" language for most of your interface code and then use C++ for you application code. I should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of TeleUSE soon in regard to C++, but I can't give you many details.  You should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture. If you want example code of how C++ integrates with TeleUSE you should look at $TeleUSE/examples/Thermometer --  +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |Steve Vranyes                                                                 | |Voice    : (708) 576 - 0338                                                   | |U.S.Post : Motorola Inc.                                                      | |           1301 E.

------------------------------------------------------------------------- Netters! I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper ones that I want to know more. The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's, but that's not really relevant at the moment. I've been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated. They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2. The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq. I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually about times 1.8.

One difference will _probably_ be the same difference as between OS2 and Windows 3.x now--one will likely have a lot of software available for it and one won't (emulation, with the inevitable incompatibilities that crop up in spite of all the contrary claims, just doesn't count when you _have_ to use a certain software package that doesn't quite run properly under the emulation...). Developers want to channel their resources toward a platform that has a large installed base, and in a case like that the platform that is most successfully _marketed_ (regardless of its relative sophistication) will win.

How can I get the font family, weight and slant from an instance of a widget? Using initFontContext(), getNextFont() and freeFontContext() I can get the size of the font (and a bunch of other stuff concerning the font) but nowhere have I found family, weight and slant. Assume that I do not have access to the source where family, weight and slant were orginaly used when creating a fontlist. Thanks a bunch and have a great day, Carl

Get the Apple kit through your dealer.  
Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do. I need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an additional resource name level. To illustrate I have an application with the following widget heirarchy: 	    Shell Widget 	         | 	Application Widghet I want the following: 	    Shell Widget 	         | 	Intermediate Widget 	         | 	 Application Widget where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget. I assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example and the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing composite widgets. Please respond via email.  Any help will be very much appreciated. jim frost
 :Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its  :486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become  :available in any non-IBM machines.  I saw in this months PC or PC World an ad for computers using IBM's 486SLC. So I don't think IBM is restricted in selling their chips, at least not anymore. A clock-tripled 486, even without coprocessor would be great, especially with 16k on-board cache. Make it 386 pin-compatible, and you have the chip upgrade that dreams are made of :-) Taka Mizutani

Oh if this would not work any idears on how to make it work??? 		thanks 		 		 alex

Hi, I got a glimpse from the other side, talking to the technician at the place I recently bought my Mac from. The guy told me that they stopped shipping SIMMs to their customers and only install them themselves - those babies get  zapped too easily by static electricity  or so they claim.

I'd love to get a >> real-world impression, though -- how is the speed?  Drivers?  Support? > The PC World reviewers found out that the Herc people had hard-coded > Winbench text into the driver. Clever, no? In any case, the Winbench > results are pretty much inflated. Two things that annoyed me about the PC Magazine review: 1.  Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown     by the Graphite and #9GXE's "cheating".  Can't they just admit that     their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach     is much harder to beat... 2.  The big "cheat" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and     PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't     do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing     PC Magazine says is that scores are not "legitimate" -- couldn't they     at least make some comment about its real-world performance? I'm not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve Gibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx Draw to benchmark).  If you believe Gibson, that is ... :)  He writes:     "Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world      applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than      any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  Even though it's      just a modest ISA bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter I      have, including the Stealth 24 VLB, the Fahrenheit 1280VA/VLB, the      ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000-based Diamond Viper VLB." This kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus WinBench or not!  :) > When and if you get one send me mail.. I might buy that ATI GU+ off > you.. 9-) I already returned the ATI GU+.  My dealer had sold eight of them, and  seven were returned to him.  I'm now (temporarily) back to running an original ATI GU, until I get my Graphite.  And, yes, the GU is faster in my 16 MB system than the GU+, especially in bitmap handling (that's where you use BitBlits). Hercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers: you can buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for 50% off list to try it out.  At just $199 for Graphite or $249 for the VLB version I decided it was worth trying (I'm supposed to get the VLB board within two weeks).  I'll post my impressions when I get it... --  [       "stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ] [          up.  that's how the corrado makes you feel."  -- car, january '93 ]

As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm). --
A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function. #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top) {         Widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars         XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class         int junk = 0;         Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                         NULL);         Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         topone,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);         XtRealizeWidget(topone);         for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when "Exit" button clicked         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         }         XtDestroyWidget(box);         XtCloseDisplay(dis); } // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top) {         int junk = 0;         (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0); } // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() {         static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called         static Widget top;         static int setup = 0;         if (!setup)         {                 SetItUp(&app, &top);                 setup = 1;         }         bla(app, top); } // main - program which links to my library main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)         {                 doit();                 printf("sleeping...\n");//widget still on screen at this point                 sleep(5);         } } The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created. (It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the "sleep" in the main prog, despite the XtDestroyWidget call). Anyone see something I'm missing? Thanks very much.

For the original XGA you just need something that can do 1024x768 at 45/90Hz interlaced (just tell them "8514 compatible" and they should get the idea).  For the XGA-2, get what you like.  I prefer multi- syncs like the IBM 6319, the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like my home Viewsonic 6.  I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like 1360x1024x16. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Dick Kaul            | My opinions only, not official IBM positions, etc-- IBM XGA Development  | they'd make me wear a suit if I were to speak for IBM.

Hi, I have a problem when compiled Wcl 2.02 in SCO ODT 2.0:         cc -c -Ox  -I.. -I/usr/include Xt4GetResL.c Xt4GetResL.c Xt4GetResL.c(47) : error C2065: '_XtConstraintBit' : undefined *** Error code 1 Although I follow the instructions in file README_BUILD to build Wcl in SCO  platform, this problem didn't resolve. So I have some questions related to this matter:   1. Does _XtConstraintBit exist in SCO ODT 2.0? ( Does _XtConstraintBit use       in X11R3 & X11R4? And What release does SCO ODT 2.0 use, X11R3 or X11R4?)   2. If not, Does someone know how to work around? 
I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit display.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the "Technicolor Effect" - which is fine.  Basically, my program works. My problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to XmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor is over the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the default colormap.  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_ window of my application, I get my colormap. Any suggestions?  Thanks, david,
Hi. While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3.1  this evening, I got a "program has violated system integrity... close all  applications, exit windows and restart your computer" error. I started to do this when I immediately got a "Serious disk error" message from Windows.  "hit return to retry".  I did that about 5 times and then rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow. (I am including the chkdsk output below.) Questions: 1)  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order? What might be some better approaches? 2)  What might have caused this?  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more vulnerable?  (I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing.) The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to  fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows and a few other things. Thanks for your comments and suggestions.

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or GlxDraw (athena) widget.

You can also set the Foreground to the XOR of the foreground and background colors:  XSetForeground(..., fg ^ bg);    This works great for me (at least with TrueColor visuals).

Who knows how old 1.15 is.  2.5 is as fast as TT, and if > you disable the small screen fonts, ATM does better screen rendering at > the smaller point sizes. Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin. TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well. > You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time, if you like. > ATM (Type 1) fonts tend to be of higher quality > and be more complete in terms of foreign characters. Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set. > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503 Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

Hi. I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better. When I set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define-keys, I can only access certain of the keys on my X-Terminal's keyboard. I can't get e.g. F10, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn; they all seem to have either the same or no keycode. I have a feeling this can't be fixed in emacs itself, but that I need to do some xmodmap stuff. Can someone help me? By the way, I've checked the X-FAQ and posted a similar message to gnu.emacs.help to no response. Currently I have the following in my .emacs file (inside a 'cond'):  ((string-match "^xterm" (getenv "TERM")) ;; done by aj 8/92. I don't know what most of this does...

I have had a Gateway Telepath modem for about a month or so now. Actually, I had one that wouldn't connect to ANYTHING no matter what software I used, so I got a new one sent to me.  This allows me to connect to my favorite News system with ZERO problems.  So I'm somewhat happier .... But I still cannot connect to my favorite DOS bbs with any kind of reliability.  I have success about 1/10 calls.  Not good!  I would hope that the fact that this one can connect to at least ONE of my fave places means I just need to adjust it. What I usually get is a fast stream of garbage, in the modem response line on the dial window. Sometimes it will drop to full screen mode first, then I get about 2-3 screens of garbage.  In both cases the modem seems to time out before connecting and drops carrier. I am using DEFAULT settings (AT&F) and getting this problem.  I am using the AUTOCONFIGURE settings that Gateway has supplied with my copy of Qmodem (ATW1&C1&D2S95=44&W0) and getting this problem. (They have refused to help me beyond this, claiming "it must be the BBS" or something like that.  Not so -- my work modem connects to this same place just fine, using factory settings -- a Microcom.)

Don't know on the last one. And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his InfoWorld column the past couple of month.  In short, virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks. In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators, and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly, they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least one card was eliminated from the "Editor's Choice" because of cheating on the benchmark. >Al DeVilbiss

What I like about GUI's: 	- The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files, 	  text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way 	  such as delete, copy, paste, rename ... 	- The ability to have several applications / screens visible 	  and accessable at the same time. 	- Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and 	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with 	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally 	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use. 	  If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do 	  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is 	  a long and painful experience. What I hate about GUI's: 	- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess 	  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a 	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something 	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my 	  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be 	  done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting, 	  searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I 	  need to use both hands for is entering text. 	I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons 	or something and then I will have the best of both worlds. 						Brent

* Attention voters: * * I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting. * Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV. * If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again. * (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day) Introduction: 	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation 	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one: 	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated) 	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to 	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated) 	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated) 	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated) 	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated) 	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting 	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to 	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer 	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules 	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started 	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993). 	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and 	comp.os.os2.bugs. 	This document contains: 	*  the background showing the need for these proposals 	*  the proposed charters for these proposals 	*  voting instructions 	*  a voting ballot 	*  some example ballots 	*  the voting rules 	*  the voting schedule 	*  the Mass Acknowledgement Background: 	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2 	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred 	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such 	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and 	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x, 	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software. 	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and 	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the 	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility 	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the 	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation 	procedures, etc. 	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows 	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is 	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version 	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1). 	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt, 	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2. 	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks 	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or 	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read 	comp.os.os2.misc for details). Proposed Charters: 	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated) 		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so 		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and 		spur additional development.  The group will also cover 		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS, 		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program 		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and 		so forth. 	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated) 		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy 		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to 		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. 		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup 		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and 		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting. 	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated) 		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the 		availability of device drivers, compatibility information, 		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall 		performance optimization. 	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated) 		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues. 	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated) 		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug 		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system 		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth. 		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other 		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in 		comp.os.os2.beta] How to Vote: 	To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me. 	Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this 	post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of 	this post. 	1)  Type in your vote for each proposal: 	    If you favor the charter as proposed, put a "yes" after its name. 	    If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a "no" after its name. 	    To abstain, leave a blank after its name. 	2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and 	    your first name (i.e. your personal name). 	3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the 	    ballot.

Proxy voting, 	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted. 	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings 	  will be revealed only after the poll closes. 	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will 	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below). 	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how 	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site. 	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is 	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis. 	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this 	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal 	  passes if both of the following formulas are true: 	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes 	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100). 	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the 	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO). 	  In other words, a proposal passes if: 	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO) 	  where max() returns the highest number given to it. Schedule: 	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted 	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator). 	This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the 	Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who 	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.

And I'd like some info...Is it possible to embed fonts in a document (Like  Write, Word, or Ami Pro?) so the file can be printed on another machine that doesn't have the font?  If possible, how is it done? I'm sorry if this is a faq...I couldn't find a faq list...I would also  apreciate knowing where that is...if a windows faq exsists.

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention. The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of the new window. > However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a > BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. >   attr.colormap = cmap; >   win = XCreateWindow( [...] >           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */ >           8,                    /* depth */ >           InputOutput,          /* class */ >           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */ >           CWColormap, >           &attr >         ); This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away. There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.) 					der Mouse
I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems. (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like                 /**/#This is a makefile         at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C         preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that         I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the         line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the         start of a directive.          However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol         as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines         that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my         imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better         fix. (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular         use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp         gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK. If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly? Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to

There's this old SE here. It's got the older-style fans that remind me of a house-ventilator. A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor I usually see. Anyway, the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due to vibration somewheres. If I remove the screws and loosen the front from the back, it quiets down. I can only assume that the fan housing from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating against it.  Anyway, any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to "stealth" this guy?

Xt Glossary ---------------------------------------------------------------------- o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code   to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with   this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,   RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,   etc.  The terms "Xt" and "Intrinsics" are used interchangeably,   however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X   window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,   Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the   Intrinsics are not especially useful. o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The   precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   Object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets. o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below   the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib   functions because Xt provides most such services although an   understanding of Xlib helps with problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Related FAQ's ---------------------------------------------------------------------- David B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It is posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ. comp.windows.x.   to comp.windows.x.motif. comp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up. Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so. Volume 6 are in error. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.   How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information. /*  * Some sample code to start up an application using something other  * than the default visual.  *  * To compile:  *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm  *  * To run:  *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow  *  * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap  * to install.  */ #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h> typedef struct { 	Visual	*visual; 	int	depth; } OptionsRec; OptionsRec	Options; XtResource resources[] = { 	{"visual", "Visual", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *), 	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL}, 	{"depth", "Depth", XtRInt, sizeof (int), 	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, }; XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = { 	{"-visual", "*visual", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}, 	{"-depth", "*depth", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} }; int main (argc, argv) 	int		argc; 	char		**argv; { 	XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */ 	Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */ 	Display		*dpy;		/* display */ 	char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */ 	int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */ 	Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */ 	XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */ 	XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */ 	int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */ 	Arg		args[10]; 	Cardinal	cnt; 	char		*name = "test"; 	char		*class = "Test"; 	/* 	 * save the command line arguments 	 */ 	xargc = argc; 	xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); 	bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *)); 	/* 	 * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can 	 * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. 	 */ 	cnt = 0; 	top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv, 			       (String *) NULL, args, cnt); 	dpy = XtDisplay (top); 	cnt = 0; 	XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources, 				   XtNumber (resources), 				   args, cnt); 	cnt = 0; 	if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))) 	{ 		XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt; 		/* 		 * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could 		 * use a default colormap based on the class of the 		 * visual; we could examine some property on the 		 * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could 		 * do all sorts of things... 		 */ 		colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy, 					    RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)), 					    Options.visual, 					    AllocNone); 		XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNcolormap, colormap); ++cnt; 		/* 		 * Now find some information about the visual. 		 */ 		vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual); 		vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy, VisualIDMask, &vinfo, &count); 		if (vinfo_list && count > 0) 		{ 			XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNdepth, vinfo_list[0].depth); 			++cnt; 			XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list); 		} 	} 	XtDestroyWidget (top); 	/* 	 * Now create the real toplevel widget. 	 */ 	XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargv, xargv); ++cnt; 	XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargc, xargc); ++cnt; 	top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL, class, 				applicationShellWidgetClass, 				dpy, args, cnt); 	/* 	 * Display the application and loop handling all events. 	 */ 	XtRealizeWidget (top); 	XtAppMainLoop (app); 	return (0); } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such). Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome. As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above  plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell. A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree. If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See section 2.8 of the Xt specification. It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things. As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget): 	Widget 	ToplevelGet (gw) 		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ 	{ 		Widget		top; 		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) 			/* empty */; 		return (top); 	} 	void 	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) 		Widget		gw;		/* widget */ 		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ 		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ 	{ 		Widget		toplevel; 		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); 		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ 		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); 		exit (0); 	} One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.   This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks. One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices. Try the following code instead. 	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h> 	extern Widget ToplevelGet ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		Widget		gw 	#endif 	); 	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		XtPointer	closure 	#endif 	); 	extern void ExitCallback ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		Widget		gw, 		XtPointer	closure, 		XtPointer	call_data 	#endif 	); 	Widget 	ToplevelGet (gw) 	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ 	{ 		Widget		top; 		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) 			/* empty */; 		return (top); 	} 	void 	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) 	Widget		gw;		/* widget */ 	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ 	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ 	{ 		Widget		toplevel; 		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); 		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ 		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); 		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw), 				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL); 	} 	Boolean 	ExitWorkProc (closure) 		XtPointer	closure; 	{ 		exit (0); 		/*NOTREACHED*/ 	} ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize. To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call. How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is "tail -f filename". It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular: 	- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while 	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other 	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race 	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this. 	- Pyramid, doesn't work at all. 	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as 	  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing 	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it 	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at 	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks 	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having 	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had 	  been given the whole block). Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages. Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, The 	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification", Digital Press, 	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by 	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC 	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL. The other book I commonly recomend to novices is: 	Xt (Motif Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8). 	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3) And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information. I read two periodicals, "The X Resource" and the "The X Journal". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  "The X Resource" is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form. "The X Journal" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call (908) 563-9033. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are three popular widget sets: Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most 	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is 	  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on 	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but 	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think 	  it is poorly implemented. OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets 	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by 	  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality. 	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get. In addition the following collection of widgets are also available: Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software 	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked 	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help, 	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen 	  them so I can't comment. FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of 	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor, 	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets 	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine 	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the 	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for 	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so 	  widely used. Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but 	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written 	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5. 	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died. 	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was 	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided 	  much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you 	  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/* The following specialized widgets are also available: Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif 	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	__________________________________________ 	Name		Language	Vendor 	__________________________________________ 	Xview		C		Sun 	OI		C++		ParcPlace 	Interviews	C++		Stanford 	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu 	__________________________________________ However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially) 	typdef struct 	{	 	    String	name; 	    long	value; 	} Arg; and the code: 	Arg	arg; 	XtSetArg (arg, "name", 3.2) expands to 	Arg	arg; 	arg.name = "name"; 	arg.value = 3.2; you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer "3" instead of the floating point value "3.2".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this? The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions. #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \     if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \         XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \     } else { \         XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \         XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \     } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values. There are several main types of resource converters:     string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type i) string to data type     Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values: 	Name		Value 	"True"		1 	"False"		0     In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most     readily accomplished by the use of the "quark" mechanism of the     resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.     If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many     converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of     these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters. ii) data type to string     This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,     the data type value is simply converted to a string value,     probably by the use of sprintf.     Data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This     mechanism can be used to provide a "snapshot" of application state     into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.     If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent. iii) data type to data type     This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be     converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for     red, green and blue. The type signature for a resource converter is as follows: typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *, 	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);     Display *dpy;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;     XrmValuePtr fromVal;     XrmValuePtr toVal;     XtPointer *converter_data; When the converter is invoked, the "fromVal" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the "toVal" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The "converter_data" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The "args" and "num_args" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel. Care must be taken with the "toVal" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value: typedef struct {     unsigned int    size;     caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr; When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True. If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True. When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro:     #define DONE(var, type) \       if (toVal->addr) \ 	{ \ 	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \ 	    { \ 	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ 	      return False; \ 	    } \ 	  else \ 	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \ 	} \       else \ 	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \       toVal->size = sizeof(type); \       return True;     #define DONESTR(str) \       if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \ 	{ \ 	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ 	  return False; \ 	} \       else \ 	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \       toVal->size = sizeof(String); \       return True; Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the "num_args" and "args" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly. Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database. To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter: void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args, 	cache, destructor)     XtAppContext context;     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor; To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter: void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args, 	cache, destructor)     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor; In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used. When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a "cache" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:     XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values     XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values     XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions). The "destructor" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition: typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer, 	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);     XtAppContext context;     XrmValuePtr to;     XtPointer converter_data;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args; The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the "to" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the "to" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered. Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution:     mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See "Multi-user Application Software Using Xt", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context. The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways: 	1. User selects a "quit" button on one of the displays, 	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message, 	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message, 	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure. I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article. The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem. The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this: #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover; void XIOHandler (dpy) 	Display		*dpy; { 	destroyDisplay (dpy); 	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); } main () { 	... 	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0) 		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler); 	XtAppMainLoop (app_context); } The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay(). For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate. Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display. There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19.

Where are the resources loaded from? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority): 	1. Args passed at creation time. 	2. Command line arguments. 	3. User's per host defaults file 	4. User's defaults file. 	5. User's per application default file. 	6. System wide per application default file. Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries. The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used. The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program "xrdb" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not. A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): 	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()): 	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the 		application's class name. 	%T	The value of the file "type".  In this case, the 		literal string "app-defaults" 	%C	customization resource (R5 only) 	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults. 	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC") 	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja") 	%t	The territory part of the display's language string 	%c	The codeset part of the display's language string Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is "Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) 	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm 	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin. Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. 	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly. NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,       for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so %T and %S are useless. With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application like this: 	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color" If one of your pathname specifications had the value "/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be "/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource. The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is: 		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ 		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ 		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N batch of default settings.) The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is  		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) 		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) 		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5) 		<root>/%L/%N:\ 		<root>/%l/%N:\ 		<root>/%N: <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether. Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to "./", a dot followed by a slash. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution. The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list. Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback says:  	"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the  	procedure is to be appended."   you may not infer from the word "appended" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- > I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible > interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core > visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag > stays set to TRUE. Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a "deficiency" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The "deficiency" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification. A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual. > Is this a problem with "mwm" or is there something > else which needs to be done? You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager. > If the problem is "mwm", what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified?  As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can't. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like: 	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)) 	if (!ptr) 	{ 		perror ("malloc in xyzzy()"); 		exit (1) 	} To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits. In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like: 	if (!ptr) 		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)); 	else 		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1)); 	++count; to be written as: 	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count); Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors. XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string: 	  struct abc *xyzzy; 	  char	     *ptr; 	  char	     *str = "abcdef"; 	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */ 	  ptr = XtNewString (str); A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as: 	 char	      *ptr; 	 ptr = XtMalloc (100); 	 /* ... */ 	 free (ptr); may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor. A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree(). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I'd recomend getting "purify" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb 	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into 	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These 	instructions check every memory read and write performed by 	the program under test and detect several types of access 	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past 	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts 	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including 	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies 	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory 	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel 	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly 	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program 	down typically by a factor of two to five. An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is "The SENTINEL Debugging Environment".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library for more info) Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the "-sync" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous. Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource "xtIdentifyWindows" or the class resource "XtDebug" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example:     example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &     example% xwininfo -tree 	     <click in new xload window> will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets. Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea. The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped. The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this: 	othermachine% xhost +thismachine 	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0; 	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger. 	or this: 	othermachine% xhost +thismachine 	thismachine% gdb application 	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0 	(gdb) run ... I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints. Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ----------------------------------------------------------------------    I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,    XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when    I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.    I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect, but in my "real" application nothing happens.  The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events. For example: 	... 	cnt = 0; 	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class, 				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc), 				   &argc, argv, 				   Fallback, args, cnt); 	XtAddTimeOut (...) 	XtAddWorkProc (...) 	XtAppMainLoop (app) would never invoke the timeout. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion. Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published. I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a "standard" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt). The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code. I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway. The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding  standard colormaps. The X11R5 documentation says: "Usually, a window manager creates  these colormaps."  I wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps. Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps. Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.     According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):     For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.       To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:             (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF     XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.     When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,      one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.     When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1,      XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs      a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives      the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would      expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is* ISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA - 8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec. This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA speed.  Heck, that's what ISA slots do - I'll just use one of those instead. --  OS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...

You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.

The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details: I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such). The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an entirely easy thing to do) and clean the "legs" of the 68000. Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades:  the 68000's "legs" will oxidize, causing  unusual system errors. Well, that's me. So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure. Will someone provide the extra 3%? Erik

>BTW, how would you rate the new "Borland Turbo C++ Visual Edition for >Windows," anyone? Time for a new discussion, maybe ? I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it. Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my "weak" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.  But..... - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows. So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all; - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.  Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please. Thanks in advance, Rafael.
This is turning into a FAQ Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own memory. 1)  Insert usual disclaimer here   2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static     precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do     this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back 	of the mac.   3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.     The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release.   4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon     SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.     The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it.                                              5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount 6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A     phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop     it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here. 7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding 	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then 	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case. 8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM     slots. 9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to     gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their 	chips facing the front of the motherboard. 	     The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in 	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely 	and firmly into a fully upright position. 	 10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into 	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.     Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place. 	 11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY     DRIVE CABLE. 12) Replace the phillips head screw 13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in. 14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount

I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.   When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen  gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't  been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story... So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what to do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance. Jude M. Greer P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set- ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size of the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.

HELP!  I really got ripped off and I need some help unripping myself. I bought a Maxtor 4380 300mb ESDI HDD from Hi-Tech for $300, then paid to get it repaired, for about another $300.  Here's the deal:  The thing works fine!  It low level formats, etc without any bad spots at all!  AND THEN... (Jaws Music) sectors start going bad!  EEK!!!  One at a time.  Norton disk doctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes. Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable and correctable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: "Ok, NDD's just not being thurough enough, I'll use Spinrite, I heard that works well." What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!   AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted again the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so. I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD, and I really can't afford it. I'm using SMARTDRIVE, and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access though, I know that can create problems).  The disk is using the second option to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then 1024 cyls, and everything else selected is standard, maybe I need to use a different head skew or something?  I don't know. ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM PLEASE TELL ME HOW!!!! HELP!!!! --  GT: "Designing tommorow the night before with yesterday's technology."

I am creating a graphics program using the Athena widgets. I use Xlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display, and window variables with the XtWindowOfObject() and XtDisplayOfObject(). The object was one of the sub widgets.     The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. I tried moving the allocation of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing changed. I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling  XtAppMainLoop().

 Hi Xperts!    I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.    previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then     i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.    I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files  required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw. In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows    BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi  and misc.  when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space.  Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , to just have my x-windows running.  Thanks Pramod   -- 
I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card.  The driver I am currently using is version 1.21 and doesn't support more  than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2MB memory.  The BBS support for Actix is unbelievable! They are still using 2400bps  modem! It will take you hours to download the drivers, it hurts when you are calling long distance. Is there any ftp site that has a collection of video drivers for windows? BTW, anyone using this card, and how do you like it so far? Thanks. --  Daniel Y.H. Wong					UofT:(416)978-1659 --

Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price titled "Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco". The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort. Without doing a complete review of the paper, I'll just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib. Features they want in FRESCO include: lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs Structured Graphics Resolution independence Natural C++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components Multithreading This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample implementation.

First off, I haven't used W4WG (but I think that's about to change!). The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general (and in this case NETX in particular) adds drives to the device chain.  Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no "unassigned" (as opposed to "unused") drive letters for NetWare to use, as it tacks its drive mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives.  W4WG obviously attaches its network drives to "existing, unused" drive letters. I'd guess the next thing I'd try is something like LASTDRIVE=M, which on most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still allow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  Nick FitzGerald, PC Applications Consultant, CSC, Uni of Canterbury, N.Z.

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for. Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. 	      The only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD" across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank. Immediately below the words "SERIAL NO", but not in the box left for the S/N, are the numbers "1990 2 8". Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated. --  Dwayne Bailey              + -- Intel advertisement, Strategic Software         +  in the June 1989 Doctor Dobbs Journal Redford, Michigan          +

Help! I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language characters (in this case Norwegian). I have been manipulating the data with Excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable files to an RS6000 workstation.  The Norwegian characters show up fine under Windows, but appear as "funny" characters on the workstation.  The workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem entering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard.  On further investigation I found that the character codes used by Windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the MSDOS code page.  The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as the workstation.  What gives, and how can get around it. Please reply by E-mail as I will be out of the office the next few days and will not be reading the news. Thanks.

I just installed a new TrueType font under MS-Windows 3.1 but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly (on a LaserJet 4 - non-PostScript printer). When I use the font in CorelDRAW, the document prints correctly, so I assume CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer. But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font. Yet, Write does display the font correctly on the screen. I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals, but got nowhere. All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print exactly as you see them on the screen---so I assume Windows knows that a font has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that????

The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid vlbus ide crap.... Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive. the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive. All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2 drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.   IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance. SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed. neither one is better in all cases. If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick up a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa busmastering cards. send flames to /dev/null..... -- ********************************************************************* *********************************************************************

Hi, I just bought a Mitsumi CD-ROM drive and a SB Pro soundcard.  The pin outs on the CD-ROM line-out and the SB Pro CD-IN are not the same.  I am considering taking the RCA output jacks on the Mitsumi interface card and routing them to the line-in input on the SB Pro.  Will this work with multi-media software that uses the CD-ROM and the SB Pro or do I need to go to the CD-IN pins on the SB-Pro. Thanks, John ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |    John Manning                       |  Opinions expressed are my own.     | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.

MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations). 	Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept. 	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.

OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.  	OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a "virtual toolkit" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice. 	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system  that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface  specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.). (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	PEX is the "PHiGS Extension to X". 	PHiGS stands for "Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics. 	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals. [last modified 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are several options for using X over serial lines: SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).  CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time). PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable. XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or "proxy" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1)	You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't  	otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly  	connected), and    (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that 	have to cross the serial interface, and    (3)	In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering  	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for  	blocks to compress. LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6. Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX 	There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM): 	wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3 	uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape. 	twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.  	awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers 	cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system.  	rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size. 	dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering 	hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm 	mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit 	tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering  Guide functionality 	gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93] 	m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape 	pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release 	swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file 	twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape 	vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available  from export. [3/92] 	tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers 	olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is  available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export. 	mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92]. twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. 	vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces. 	piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like: 		exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application "xplaces" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90] 	Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname: 	sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using "xset r on|off". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems. 	Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options "-ar1 350 -ar2 30" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do "macro expansion." 	Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as: 	xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \ 		<Key>F1: string("setenv DISPLAY unix:0") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include. 	Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special "remapper" client been made available. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 		"Just the FAQs, ma'am." -- Joe Friday  --  David B.

The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things. 	I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without  giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when  you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions. Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to  its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster? 	Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up.   	But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure processor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will work well and another will not based on its design, then we can get somewhere with our discussions.   - Chung Yang >In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was > slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel.

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother. (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...) NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box. The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines? So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.

If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device. So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA-AT bus at the same time. Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book, but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): "The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers." I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.   So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense.

This is why Apple's comment was >that >they believe it is not possible to make a Mac clone without infringing >on their patents.  They may have other patents like this. Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region. I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files, there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure. I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware, and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What other patents does Apple have on the Mac? --  MapInfo Corp. 200 Broadway       These are my own opinions.

Hi netlanders, Does anybody know if there is something like Macintosh Hypercard for any UNIX  platform? Thanks in advance Ron.
After a rough start purchasing a 486 system (see earlier post), I'm trying again.  I'm looking at the following system offered by EPS Technologies: - 486dx 33mhz w/ 256K static RAM cache,AMI Bios - 3 32-bit VESA local bus slots, 3 16-bit slots, 1 8-bit slot - Teac 1.2 & 1.44 mb floppy drives - Maxtor 170 MB hard drive (15 ms) IDE w/64K cache buffer - 32-bit vesa local bus video card w/ 1mb RAM 1024 X 768 NI (I *think* it's an    Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 card) - 14" NI Multisync monitor 1024 X 768 - 101 Keyboard - 200 Watt power supply - Windows 3.1, Mouse, DOS 6.0 - *3* years limited warranty - 1 year on-site service I'm probably going to add the $125 for a 15" flat-screen digital monitor, and will also want to go for at least 8 mb RAM ($159 extra). Has anyone bought from EPS Technologies, particularly a system like the one I'm considering.  I'm especially interested in their warrantee and service. Can anyone recommend other companies who offer similar packages, with support, and comparable prices (I see FastMicro just bit it...). Thanks in advance, -Toby Loftus Brown University

I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called 8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card.

Be very careful when you plug in a external monitor and a external speaker. Make sure that all the power cords are in the same strip.  If you don't you take a chance of having a very bad audio buzz.  This is caused be a "ground loop" and the only way of getting rid of this loud buzz is to make sure that you  have a common ground.                                 Make sure that all the power cords are going in to the same strip or off the  same outlet.  This will assure you of a common ground. Tim Keanini           Sound Designer

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are adjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central USA distribution point (MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that the >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore *expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor* (not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor (the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my case quite :). >Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC, finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO, but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was "normal"). The short answer is no, don't accept these "imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and if you're persistent, you'll receive it. >............................................................... >:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             : >: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park, NC : >...............................................................

Hello fellow 'netters. I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.  I thought, rather than trust the salesperson, I would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential.  And, I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson. Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi). Which is faster?  Is there a noticeable print quality difference, particularly in graphics?  Which will handle large documents better (75 pages or more) -- any personal experience on either will be appreciated here?  Which works better under Windows 3.1 (any driver problems, etc)? Cost of memory, font packages, toner cartridges, etc?  Basically, your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable, both good and bad. Advance kudos and thanks for all your input.  E-mail or news posting is readily acceptable, but e-mail is encouraged (limits bandwidth). -- Sincerely, "In theory, theory and practice are the same.  In practice, they are not."

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe. Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac. Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals. --   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed rectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the enclosing rectangle of your new item. This is still not great, since any other items contained within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn. If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be doing much more work than just drawing the new item "on top" of the existing scene. -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Mike Yang        Silicon Graphics, Inc.

Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings. I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes. Hope this helps. Victor

        I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is familiar with them.           The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB tower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a Mitsumi CD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14" CTX 1468NI, 128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is $2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it IS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen a review of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or of the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be appreciated.           In a similar vein, the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14" MI monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig benefit here as well.           Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities.   	Email response would be greatly appreciated.

I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do 1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. However, it is a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 kHz horizontal, I think. With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62 - not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to something else, especially if it wants to do text, I suppose.

Are there any graphics cards for the SE/30 that also have, say, an 040 accelerator?  There seem to be plenty of accelerator/graphics cards for the _SE_, but none (that I've seen) for the SE/30. Thanks Matt Madsen

I've been running Dos 6 for about a month.  I was generally impressed with the improvements:  the multiple boot configurations were great, the new commands were nice, and DoubleSpace worked fine (twice as slow for large data transfers, twice as fast for small with SmartDrv). Until now. This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper, I had to reboot a hung Dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within Windows 3.1. When my machine finished rebooting, I found my windows directory and about two thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted. I cannot afford problems like this.  I'm returning to Dos 5. mark P.S.  I've also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should       exist.

I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card. Some have been positive but most are negative. Could people please confirm these?  (I am interested in the EISA version in particular). 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM. 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches    set but it is much slower. 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes. 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many    cases. 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money. 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-) Thanks for your feedback.

Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to  serial port weirdness.  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX handheld.  Everything else worked okay on that port, but not the HP. (it runs on two penlite batteries).  It turned out that the plus (by accident or by  design flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing  weird things to the HP (which has only 3v dc!).  The HP worked fine when  connected to the printer port.   Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device?  Have you  tried using the printer port?

I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining 5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing. The error message reported was like: Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out. This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes 2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors, but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however, I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:    o Frequent crashes    o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to        correct.    o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.        - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the          disk either.        - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes          requires several attempts. QUESTIONS:    1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?    2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard       SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some       diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?    3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest       and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the       end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx       terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal       drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with       one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).       I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;       so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of       course who knows :-< Help would be much appreciated. Forrest E.

Well, I'm amazed at how successful this exercise was. I received 20 responses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made it possible. On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL string and receive the results. Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other  products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase, RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL. For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the source code, and portability is important in my application. It works with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files. However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising. It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp, except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals: the "ODBC Programmer's Reference" and the "ODBC SDK Guide". Moreover, ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's  up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also, it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK).  Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should make life interesting in the future. Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by  a line of asterisks (*). > Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have libraries for accessing > their respective databases (Paradox, FoxPro) from within C programs? > I'd really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pass it > to a function which returns the query results in some format.

When I tried to compile  the engine's sample applications with the Waterloo WATCOM C/C++ (32-bit) compiler, it complains that the library file LLIBCE.LIB  is missing even though I am quite certain that the file is NOT part of WATCOM C or the engine. Anybody have any success with  other C compilers? -------------------- **************************************************************************** I'm currently developing an app. with Borland's "Paradox Engine for C" (it also comes in Pascal), which has recently gone to version 3.0 (I.e., PX Engine 3.0 is compatible with Paradox 4.0, and downward compat. w/3.5).  There are indeed C libs for Fox access, but I can't think of the names offhand - I'm sure someone has already written you in that regard - (I think I just saw an add for a Fox lib in the "C Users Journal", which is a good place to look for this type of package in general, by the way). I've been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of PX Eng. over the past year - wouldn't recommend it for a complex multiuser app.--but I'm staying with it for now--it's like a bad marriage: I've got too much time invested in learning and work-arounds!  But if your interest is limited to a simple single-user interface (you want to build your own SQL engine, I take it), PX Engine will do the job easily - it doesn't sound like you'll be bumping into any of the gotchas.  If you do, write me; I may be able to point you in the right direction. **************************************************************************** Borland has a "Paradox Engine and Database Framework 3.0" which gives you a "C" (and assembler?) API to Paradox databases.  This is part of "BOCA" -- Borland's Object Component Architecture.  They have technical briefs on BOCA, PdoxEng, and other products of theirs. -------------------  James D.

Terry, I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E. I don't remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard. The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works.               I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the           keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them the keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free. tell me if you have a similar experience with them. -David Mirsky

Hello,   I just got some SIMMs,  at least one of which does not work. I don't know if  there is a software that can test SIMMs thoroughly or I could just rely on the  RAM test performed by my computer during the start up. When I installed a dead  SIMM into an LC or  an LC II, there would be a strange music and no display on  the screen. Why? I need your help! Thanks in advance Yih-Tyng
I want to go from 512K to 1M VRAM on my Quadra 800.  How many 512K SIMMS do I need to buy?  Is the current 512K soldered on the board or do I need to take out the current VRAM before I add more? Thanks, Wesley Stuart Jones -- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation. When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.    The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.    Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas? More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),        with the most current operating system and running X11R5.        It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.

Once the demand fall off a bit, then is the time to start getting aggressive with pricing.  Waiting too long can really hurt your business though :-) The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowing down Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (the only reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a $900 PB100, the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).

Hi folks Say, I'm new to R5 and have one quick question. In using xon ( xon  <machine_name> )  , I notice that it always comes up with a very small window .  I'm pretty sure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally. Is xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ? xrdb -q appears to show the right stuff. I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc and everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a  simple script to do this , but I have a feeling I'm missing something simple here. Comments / suggestions appreciated. Thanks in advance Bob

To following up my own note: : : : : It looks like everything works as advertised but I am disappointed : : with the speed.  I'm using an Intel 400 internal 14.4k modem in the PC : : with Telebit 14.4k on the Unix end, which are currently limited to : : 19.2Kbits by the Unix com link. To get a quantitative comparison, I : : did 'cat file' where "file" is 20 kbyte uncompressed ascii text, and : : it took 75 seconds to scroll through an X window over the modem link, : : 270 chars/sec.  Using the identical hardware and Procomm+FW the same : : "cat file' takes 11 seconds, 1820 chars/sec.  BTW, I use NCD PC XView : : on my PC at work (HP) every day for the same Unix access from a PC over : : a LAN and like that just fine.  The same 'cat file' scrolls by in : : ~2 seconds on the LAN connection. I just tried a few experiments. I cat'd a 20261-byte file (471 lines) under various scenarios: PC-Xview for DOS in a full-screen OS/2 window (1024x768x16):    18 sec Telix (DOS) in an OS/2 window (1024xs768x256):                  107 sec! Telix (DOS) in a Windows 3.1 window (1024x768x256):             30 sec UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window (1024x768x256):        gave up after 4 min! UW/WIN in Windows 3.1 (1024x768x256):           faster, but gave up after 2 min UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window using pg       30 sec, could have been a                                                 little faster (I had to keep                                                 hitting the space bar) I was using an ATI Wonder XL video card, by the way. So PC-Xview for DOS looks pretty good (and the line-by-line scrolling in OS/2 desktop looks pathetic, although full-page redraws are pretty good). I tried it under PC-Xview using my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font, and with a very small font, and there was no difference in the times. The modem receive light was on pretty solidly, so it looks like the bottleneck was the 9600-baud modem, not the screen drawing. -- ISG Technologies Inc.   6509 Airport Rd., Mississauga  Ont.

------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers ------- You've heard about Apple's great new customer "support" program.  Well, think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on: In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice "stick" in the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of BCGA65431. You'll recognize this "sticky button" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle. Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead  suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly (_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed) range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it. Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it. Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:                   United States      1-800-776-2333                   Canada             800-665-2775                   UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01                   Australia          61-2-452-8000                   Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500 If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register the details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm. Network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user bases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to me or post yet another "sticky-button" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If enough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple will eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy to stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the next, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered. -- Bill Sloan

I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to 27.5 mhz. I'm waiting on delivery of a 62 mhz clock for a final speed trial. Definitely needed the heatsink. The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued on a 90 cent Radio Shack sink.  I made a call for reports of failures last week. No reports have arrived here. Locally, in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactly a problem due to the CPU running too fast. I think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system configurations including PDS and Nubus cards which were used. I'd be happy to coordinate and report results

It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some purposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve). Otherwise the other possibilities would be: 1) get a digital voltameter with serial output & connect to serial port on mac, collect data with some communications program. 2) Buy an A/D chip from Analog devices, Burr-Brown, etc, connect to a parallel to serial converter, use serial port for acquisition (nah. too much soldering and trouble shooting :-) 3) Get a board from National Instruments, Data Translation, Omega, etal.

It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive, which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs. The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of which are pretty good. The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around $600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's unless you buy it in a bundle. Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's speed and performance.  BTW, the models of the drives are: is also something like with 3401) NEC:  CDR-74 I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not. Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california, my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is just a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the enormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has three Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and lives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.

Things like a "Intro to Nautilis", a sample CD of Kodak pictures, "From Alice to Ocean" (a story of a woman who treked across Austrailia), 3 discs from apple, a games disc, an applications disc, and a "titles" disc (haven't checked most of these out yet).

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was  able to help me. The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create  detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until  main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls: main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 main_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,                 main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win); The event mask for main_win is: 	PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |  	EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask; The flags are 	PPosition | PSize I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values): detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,                 detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask. If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win  are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear  from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some  detail I'm overseeing. Thanks for any tips ---> Robert

Hi Everyone, I would like to get an example program(source code) to get started with a simple editor (similar to windows dialog editor, but lot simplified) . Can someone point me to a source such as a programming windows book, or example program comes with Windows SDK (from Microsoft or Borland). I would greatly appreciate it. All I want to do is to be able to place a edit control or combobox or a listbox on a window and be able to drag and resize. If anyone has written similar program and don't mind sharing code or ideas,  I would appreciate it very much. Thnx in advance, Manu Das
We are trying to connect an Olivetti XM4311 5" floppy drive as the second drive on a Panasonic 286 machine.  It seems to sort of talk to it (gets it spinning and stepping) but gives a "Disk not ready" error. There are two jumpers (which seem to work best open), a 3 position DIP switch, and a 8 position DIP switch.  We don't know how to set the DIP switches and think that may be the problem. Any information, or advice (other than "junk the stupid thing" :) would be most appreciated, thanks.  (email reply preferred).
Please reply via EMail... When I use the terminal software for Windows such as TERMINAL.EXE or  Crossttalk, it doesn't use the whole window.  I mean, when the software's window size is max, it still scrolls around the 2/3 of window.  It does not use whole window.  I set "stty rows 30", but still the same. Scrolls at 2/3 from the top of the windows.  Could anyone tell me how to setup these software to use whole window? Thanks in advance.

I read it directly from the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent disturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a row and keep the lower results.

Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware, and therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how when acessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I  imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time, and sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.  I can't even run in  medium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSI machine which places extra demands on the data bus. don

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field. The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done. When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

I've recently ordered a Centris 650 and need to decide on which modem to buy.  I'm pretty sure I want to get a fax/data modem that can run at 14.4k, but is it worth it?  I'll primarily only be 'conversing' over CompuServe or some other link to the Internet, but I'm not sure if those systems can supply ME with data at 14.4k.  Another question I have is in some of the modem lingo out there.  I understand baud rates, but what does V3.4 and V3.4bis mean?  I could really use some suggestions as to what a good modem for around $300 would be, and why it would be a good choice. Thanks for your time.

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

There are value-added dealers (nothing to do with VAT, no flame please) that are very legitimate. CDA unfortunately is one of those that replace the serial number with their own to prevent Apple from tracing which authorized dealer sold that machine to CDA. --   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

While this will definitely not make the initial public release of WinTrumpet, it will follow on shortly thereafter. Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta.  It looks like an excellent  product, with several features beyond the DOS version. WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP, Novell LWP, and there is also a direct to  packet driver version that some people are using with the dis_pkt shim.

Sorry if this has been beaten to death on this forum. I am looking seriously at buying a 486 DX / 33 from Gateway. I will probably buy it without a monitor, as I've heard negative stuff about Gateway monitors. I've also heard its tough to get through to technical support. I'm seeking opinions on whether or not its wise to go ahead based on criteria such as price, warranty service, general ruggedness of the system, reliability of the machine and of Gateway too, and so on. Please advise!! Thanks in advance!

AY> AY> Many thanx in advance! AY> AY>Andrew. Andrew, yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486.  If you are  considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice  size external cache!  The performance is far greater. The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX  has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither  systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is  still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ). -rdd ---  . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

:  : Okay, here is my configuration: :  : 80486-33 Gateway 433C Micronics ISA : 12MB RAM  : WD212MB IDE HD ( drive C: ) : ST3144A 125MB IDE HD ( drive D: ) : Adaptec SCSI 1542B controller, with SCSI BIOS enabled : Seagate ST296N 80MB SCSI drive :  : Alrighty, when I boot up I get the Adaptec BIOS message, but it says : something like: :  : "Drive C: installed" : "Drive D: installed" : "ADaptec SCSI BIOS not installed!" :  : And I can't get to the Seagate drive. :  : I go into PhoenixBIOS setup, remove the entry for drive D:, and BOOM, I can : access the Seagate.  Is there a way to get two IDE drives and the Seagate : at the same time?  I have ASPI4DOS.SYS, but it just hangs the system. :  : Brian :  There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only work as the first or second drive.  Any "built-in" drives e.g. IDE are installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do. The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I have seen a similar situation before.

(NOTE: The followups are set to comp.os.os2.misc.  DMQS files describe monitors and valid modes to be used by the XGA-2 under both Windows and OS/2.) THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  IBM has nothing to do with these files or this post.  It's personal this time (and every time I post -- see the signature). Due to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I've collected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision of the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows with the drivers available to the general public at this time.  All files will function under the most recent OS/2 2.1 beta and those I've tried have worked under OS/2 2.0+SP.  Not all files have been fully tested. THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  They represent a personal collection, not anything resembling an officially supported set. As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts: 1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can    stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in    shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-). 2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of    spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor. 3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability    to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking    in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play    around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable    about what you're doing. 4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files    you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.    Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files. THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your warrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don't have that many monitors. c:\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation diskette to change your adapter or settings. You will need PKZip 2.x if you don't have the INFOZIP utilities. files for your favorite monitors.

	I'm attempting to transfer files from my home computer running Windows 3.1 Terminal to a workstation at school.  The file transfer protocol at home is Kermit for binary files.

One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect. Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring. Wayne Rash

  I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc. It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much).   well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires.   there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.   if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.   btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes).

I have an IBM and run Windows 3.1.  A friend installed Norton Desktop For Windows on top of this.  It loads automatically when I type "win", and surely adds to the (already dismally slow) process of starting up. I would like to know how to STOP or uninstall this program!! I have taken it out of win.ini, but it still pops up running with windows. I did a big search and found reference to it in ndw.ini, system.ini and progman.ini.  Removing it here causes a failure when starting up windows (progrman.ini has a "group 7 = ...ndw.exe..." which can't be deleted.) Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off?? 		thanks!		Chet **PLEASE EMAIL RESPONSES  -- I can't read news from my home account***

As most of you know, we have recently changed our standard VESA local-bus video card from our own NCR-based card to the new Diamond Stealth 24 VLB card for packages 2, 3, and 4 (package #1 still has the NCR "screamer').  We also have added the $149 upgrade from the Stealth 24 or NCR to the Diamond Viper to our product list.

Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse jumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse. (Sorry, I didn't say the solution was free.) In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse. (Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so used to it I didn't notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a month, noticed the improvement literally within a second! I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button. Hope this helps someone else. If you're anywhere near as frustrated as I was, it's well worth the $80. --- Stephen Thomas   AT&T Tridom   (404-514-3522)
I've been trying to get my Fujitsu M2611T 45mb hard disk (circa  1990) to share my IDE card with a new Seagate ST3283A 245mb one.   I've tried fiddling the jumpers to set the master and slave drives  without any success  [without the table of hard drive specs from  this newsgroup I couldn't have got that far]. Has anyone else got this combination to work.  The place I got the new one muttered something like "Hmmm  Fujitsu, nice drives, not very compatible."  He'll let me swap the Seagate for another brand  but he thought it was more a problem with the Fujitsu. So has anyone got a similar Fujitsu drive to work with another cheapish  disk ... or want to buy a cute and cuddly little Fujitsu drive ? Andrew  Henry

I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one I already had.  My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is,  the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these.   Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the "master" drive and which into the "Slave"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

Can someone help me? It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem, and have given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what keys it will accept, and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun from my HP, and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not sufficient, or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work. However, I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work, and I do some customised things with them. Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem, and I am using exactly the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

When I use telix (or kermit) in WIN 3.1, or use telix after exiting windows to dos, telix can not find the serial port. If you have some ideas on how to solve this problem or where I can find further information, send me email or send it to the news group.  Thanks.

In Windows I created a permanent Swap-file of 7771Kb as win3.1 recommended me to do that (32bit access). If I use EMM386.EXE, after win3.1 startup I have 6689K of memory free, if I leave EMM386.EXE out of my config.sys I have 9935K of memory free, and windows recommends me a swap file of 11769K. I use DOS6, with memmaker, have 4MB of internal Memory and a 486DX, Does anybody knows why this is happening (possibly win needs some UMB's to manage virtual memory?, If true, which UMB's, those that EMM386 can find without including suspicious parts?) I need an optimized DOS-environment, because i develop applications for DOS using a windows programming environment. Rudi
Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup, and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!). One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said: "Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.  Any feedback will be appreciated. The system configuration is: Gateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus 16 Megs Ram SCSI HD & CD-ROM Ultrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM DOS 6.0 Windows 3.1 Mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59) Thanks in advance. -- 
I've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550C from Word for Windows. it would disable reverse printing since there seemed to be a bug that interferred with printing envelops.  That bug is still present, however... the printer I bought in December) still wants to print the envelops in PORTRAIT mode.  However, the DeskJet 550 feeds envelops the from the narrow end (i.e. landscape mode).  How do I get the printer to print the envelops in the correct orientation?

Somewhere in this thread, it has been said that Windows NT (tm) is a  multi-user OS, as well as multi-threading, etc.  I certainly haven't seen this to be the case.

You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long     it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time     is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time     is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste      of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it     would speed it up some, but the time would still be there. --  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  John A.

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for! V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster. This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory. Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making  cards to fit in the other two.  How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at 130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over 1Mb/s.

Some BIOSes do not automatically install  COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which  write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call  fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put  "device=pf.sys" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat.  This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS  tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and  such also if that is of any value to you.

Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM: I put 2 256K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra 700 (in the 2 slots closest to the RAM SIMM slots) and I got no results whatsoever.  I have been told that the built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on a Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel still lists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible. Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in? Do you have to do something to activate them? Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel? BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM. --- Charles P. Cox, Jr. Computer Engineering Case Western Reserve University

I just recently bought a 4 MB ram card for my original mac portable  (backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. It happens when I put  the machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just  freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset  switch. Other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error  message of "Co processor not installed".  I know one solution is NOT to put the machine to sleep, but does anyone  have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix  it? The memory card is Psuedostatic ram and goes into the PDS Slot. That  probably figures into the problem. the manufacturer is King Memory (Not  kingston) from irvine, CA. They say the problem is in my machine.  Any Ideas? -- Gene Wright. -- ------------jackatak.raider.net   (615) 377-5980 ------------

I have had a Zeos for a couple months.  While the experience was not painless or perfect, it was way better than that endured by most (7 people I personally know) who have ordered Gateways.  (Of course, several of the Gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as Gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent out...B{)  I got the 1 MB Viper card.  The first one was defective, but Zeos replaced it with only minor hassles.  This one works fine.  I haven't noticed any problems in any of my applications.  I also ordered it because of all the complaints about the ATI a few months ago.  Guess you can choose either buggy state-of-the-art stuff, or robust average stuff....  For my particular configuration (tower, 300 watt supply, pkg#3, no monitor, viper, etc.) the Zeos was slightly cheaper than Gateway, Austin, etc.  But this can change from month to month. Mike

>What's the word on the chipset?  Is this a ROM bug specific  >to a specific brand using the Rockwell, or is it the Rockwell >chipset itself? There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it from someone else. However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used "speed buffering" instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the "speed buffering" works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board. Hope this helps... Tom --  |AMD PCD MS-520 | 5900 E.

Subject: .GIF to .BMP Does anybody have any idea where I could find a program that can convert a .GIF image into a .BMP image suitable for a Windows  wallpaper (i.e. 256 colors).  Hopefully there's something out there I can get from an ftp site somewhere... Thanks in advance... Scott

This would be very helpful! |  | Thanks! What it has to do with your original question is this: many times  beginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test programs.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's graphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  We're just trying to eliminate all the "easy" explanations  for why you're not seeing your graphics.  That being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  Try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7 to see it you get any output.  Since you're dipslaying only a single  plane of your data, it's possible that all the pixel values in your pixmap have the same value for that color plane.

Yet again, the escape sequences you are speaking about here are non standard and dangerous. In fact, an ANSI compliant sequence parser HANGS on them. Why are there such strange ESC sequences instead of compatible DSC ? -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

Hi! A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current).  The consensus at the time was that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer, I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down converter is employed if 240 V current is used).  The same info, turns out, can be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really trust that.  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?  Just  wondering.

Hello, This is my first net letter, so forgive mistakes! I have been plagued by problems (or lack of info) with authorization in Open Windows 3.0 for a long while and would like some help please!  I generally use strait MIT X, and so don't use OW much, but when I share  X software with others - bad news. PROBLEM: My friend who logs into his SSII trys to run my  program that runs fine on my machine, however,  my friend gets "client not authorized to connect  to server" (or something close).  If OW is started with the -noauth option all is well, but surely this is not required in general! Also, xhost + does not work, becoming root does not  work, etc...  Any help will be greatly appreciated! Thanx
Are there any vendors supporting pressure sensitive tablet/pen with X? I will appreciate any pointers. Thanks, Sanjay --

: I have a 5 1/4" drive as drive A.  How can I make the system boot from : my 3 1/2" B drive?  (Optimally, the computer would be able to boot : from either A or B, checking them in order for a bootable disk.  But : if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that : it can't boot 5 1/4" disks, that's OK.  Also, boot_b won't do the trick : for me.) :  : Thanks, :   Davebo We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway.  I finally got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives.  The only reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several bootable 5-1/4's and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected the A drive.  I order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and the number of "stupid" install programs that can't handle an alternate drive are declining with time - the ones I had are now upgraded.  And as for the bootable 5-1/4's I just cut 3-1/2 replacements. If switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up a drive switch to your computer chasis.  I haven't tried it but I think it would work as long as it is wired carefully. Gordon Lang

Hi, I am going through a box of old IBM card and came across one called a  Rapid Technology SQUEEZE card.  It is dated 1990 and has a 54mhz crystal on it and a big chip that has 'C-Cube' on it. No connectors to the outside, but a ribbon-type 50-pin connector on the board. It is a 16-bit board. Any ideas what it is?

I just got off the phone with Mathsoft technical service. They are now admitting a problem of unknown nature with Maple and Norton Desktop for Windows. They have no clue at this time and are collecting configuration information on the systems which exhibit the problem. Anyone having problems loading the Maple solver in MathCad 4.0 under NDW shoud call technical support at 617-577-1017. They made no schedule promices, but are actively working on the problem. In the meantime, the workaround is to provide a configuration selection in autoexec.bat to use PROGMAN (yuk, pew) whenever you plan to use the Maple solver and NDW otherwise. I am using Norton BE to place a little menu on the screen with a 5 second timeout to auto boot NDW. +---------------------------------+----------------------+ |    _/      _/     _/    _/  _/  | David A.

> My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state > of CapsLock and/or NumLock is? Alright.  Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and found what I was looking for. ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask). eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance. 			Thanks, Ralph
>hi, >  Have you used Mac system 6.x or 7.x? If the answer is positive, you would >know if ms-windows is a "mature" OS. > >  Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why >they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft [Common complaints about MS Windows deleted...] >Jesse 	Hmmmm, why do I get the feeling that this is gonna start one of those endless threads 'Mac Vs Win" and might even end up as "OS/2 Vs Win". Well, I dont know if Windows is a mature OS, if I have seen one (in which case that has to be X-Windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge...  First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself thought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace- ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do that, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kinda hard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not paying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differet story ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :).. PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your  settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'... I dont wanna get in the discussion which is a better system: Mac's are good in their own way -- they are _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs-- (actually I am writing this from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win:) ) By all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under the pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for StarTrek (Mac's OS on a PC !!! -- the threads we are gonna have then !!! :) )...

For image display, about 10 frames per second seems to be the lower limit for interactive operations. For just bringing up an image for viewing less than 1 second seems to be a good number. Of course the measure of response time should be based on the applications you are planning to run.
>I am looking at buying some Companion brand VLB/ISA/EISA motherboards with >HINT chipsets.  Has anybody had any experience with this board (good or bad)? >Any information would be helpful! >thanks >Brian J Schaufenbuel I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look- ing to replace it for exactly this reason. Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA DMA. Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a EISA SCSI host adapter. --  Network Management Technology Incorporated Sugar Land, Texas       (713) 274-5357

Hi, Can anyone tell me the difference between ~30-pin and 72-pin Simms? I wish to get detailed information about the origin of these two different types of Simms, preferably a magazine review aricle. By the way, if there is a FAQ for this group which covers the Simms information, please also direct me to it. Any help/information would be very much appreciated.

Anyone out there have a Sony 1304S? I have one, and it's very nice, however - If I run it in 16" mode, the picture won't go very big. I end up with about 1" gap either side, and .5" top & bottom. I suspect an internal adjustment would fix this. Anyone tried it? Another problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or off the main raster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the screen is blanked. This is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens I have used. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not visible, the real image virtually disappears! The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too much! Oh, and I am using a RasterOps 24XLi card.

|  | Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some | documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server- | resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code | mentioned above... There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).   I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write) If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device. One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them. One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., "kill").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments. 	Ken -- Kenneth Whaley			 (408) 748-6347 2630 Walsh Avenue Santa Clara, CA.  95051
[posted for a friend] Okay, I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this, but I know its come up before... XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:     Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)     Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match. 	and when all else fails,      Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors      already allocated in the colormap. This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and  no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has  already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens  of read-only cells already in the colormap. Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part? Any help appreciated,
Hi.  I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as CapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of my window and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in another window?  I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitely NOT what I wanted to do.  I could find no convenience function to tell me that information. My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state of CapsLock and/or NumLock is? An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X keyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie, CapsLock is active, and the user presses shift-a, I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'. Any input is greatly appreciated. Please respond via email.  I will repost a summary of my findings. 			Thanks, Ralph
I would like more info on this if anybody has it. Our Exabyte 8500 tapedrive has never been working from the Quadra 950. We have been trying it since September 1992, replaced cabling, inits, I don't know what all. All the "industry experts" we phoned (the tapedrive dealer, our Apple dealer, the software dealer) all say it's our fault, or they don't know. The last thing they said was that we needed a special Quadra SCSI terminator (???). Anybody know more? Thanks,

If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay #around when the window is refreshed. # #Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with: # #   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */ #   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */ #   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red; #   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green; #   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue; #   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1); #   XFlush( myDisplay); # #   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor); #   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex); # #Then to draw I do: # #   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2); #   XFlush( myDisplay); # #And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do: # #   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy); # # #What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of #whatever I'm drawing over.

I've been hearing rumblings about Fresco, and it sounds like it may be what I'm looking for, but how far is it from release, or at least some kind of availability?  How similar is it to InterViews?  If I code to InterViews, will my code work with Fresco?  How about Motif?  I've heard some mention of versions of InterViews which support Motif.  Will it be feasible to use Motif with Fresco?

Hi,   I have normal procomm plus for dos, but I've been considering buying the windows version....it got really great reviews in computer shopper. I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here using it, but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the modem....he has a 14,400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine.  I can't see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great, but the windows just seems to always screw up....Is this common and is there a fix?  Or is something just screwed with his machine? 					Kent

It doesn't happen I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design System (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2, Sys 7.0.1*. Normally, MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround, but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text, etc, inside the window become "washed out" (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT. By slightly moving the window, and forcing a re-draw, the colors get corrected.

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use "slower" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash. Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.   Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus  slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

I believe that in order to get at the innards of the new mouse, you must remove the label on the bottom that says "Apple Desktop Bus Mouse II"  There you should find two screws on either side.

	alone and may not represent the views of the IBM PC User Group. Can anyone give me some information, please ... I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source, or can I make do with the public headers that are provided? "Motif" includes Xt in this context. One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class. Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)? Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they could sell me, this might save me from having to write one! Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not yet have the spec)? Answers appreciated, Nicholas. --  Nicholas Young (+44 71 637 9111)
Subject: "Full page" PB screen Hi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a "full page" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000. Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: 1. If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen 2. How much you would be willing to pay for it 3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful, but who knows!), please send me some. Thanks in advance!!! -Mike

Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either. Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path. explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on MB1). --  Open Software Foundation			uunet!osf.org!dbrooks Showres soote my foote

Walther, I'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering. I'd only suggest using the color screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. If this is not too small for your tastes at a 14".... Personally I'd prefer the mono-screen as I always have quite a few windows open. If you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color 'surplus' is worth trading in  the smaller size. If you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors. I used a 14" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked I choose on a color screen.   Regards, Olaf Winkelhake
With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me: 1.  What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.) 2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the C650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)

Yes! what you are saying is absolutey true, but what you fail to mention is the fact that the LCIII uses the new 72 pin simms which allow 32 bit access to each simm.

>: The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed. I was at the Trenton Computer Fest and there were many sources of ink refills for the HP and Canon, so if you don't like the ink you're using, you have a choice.  There is a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) list that's reposted occasionally that reports how to refill the cartridges yourself with inks that are available from the stationery store instead of a "specialty" ink with the specialty price. I'm not sure, but I think I found another legal source of cheap hypos for injecting ink into the cartridges. More on that when my mail order succeeds. --  Jeffrey Jonas

To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick: 	1. Set the window background to None, 	2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True), 	3. Restore the window background to its correct value. The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.

Can anyone out there tell me how to get the total number of color cells allocated in the default colormap? e.g.   colormap = DefaultColormap(mydisplay, myscreen); The MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCells(mydisplay, myscreen), but in general the number of cells actually allocated will be much less than this, depending on the color requirements of the windows currently in place. I'd like a way to determine this number. Thanks in advance! Derek ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

Somebody please post it....he deserves the credit for saving us all $$$$$) it is easily fixed, if it is the same problem...... Best I can figure it is due to time, heat and repeated warmup/cool downs in the power supply....i.e., bad solder joints in the power supply circuit card.  Go get a desolder tool from radio shack, a low wattage iron and some good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit card with the AC plugs facing away from you..........or get someone to do it for you.  It took me less then 10 minutes and saved me at least $300 for a new supply!

The University has neither 	control over nor responsibility for the opinions of users. >Anyway, is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs? >Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions?  Maybe PC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance management programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library. I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances. Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share: 	The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts: 	checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile 	your account statements with the records the program keeps. 	The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that 	budget. 	A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill 	paying service to pay your bills via your modem. 	 	The ability to print checks on your printer. 	The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments. 	The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts 	up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically 	via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it. 	The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation 	programs. Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not: 	A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to 	predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine 	tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early. 	An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep 	records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records. 	It can also compute your life expectancy. 	A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,  	effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to 	maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and 	loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you  	decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford 	a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good 	investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether 	a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation. 	This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping 	your kids with their tuition.   	A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets 	and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this  	information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules 	are automatically included here. 	A "desk" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file 	you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital 	information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a 	rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment 	list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to 	track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list 	can be made to display automatically when you start the program. There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp. One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year. I hope this information is of use to you.  I've found Managing Your Money to be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand I know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all the features you need or want, I'd go with it. If you find any of the Managing Your Money features that Quicken doesn't have to be useful, I think it's well worth the price.

I'm an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into, I ftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid. What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed, binary,ascii) about multiple platforms.  My guess is that it is the copy to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  Any help is appreciated. bob
>>So, by going mailorder through Gateway, I save ~13%.  Plus, I get >>technical support over the phone, free software package. >Have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone.  At least >locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong, and >he has to fix it.     ^^^ How long does he have to take in fixing it?  Does he have to use new parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part?  When it comes to local dealers: - Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their "techs" are re-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate. - Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously. - Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done period, unless you are on a paid service contract. Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what I'm talking about.  I also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers like to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers having been singing for years -- "Buy from me and you'll get good service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition and you'll be sorry if you need service."  Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts,  on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good  service, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point,  but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.

As a result mail order companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market. This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have more machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better wholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serial nunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void. You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping. I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer cost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs and trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well.  The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest prices available from authorised local dealers. They are even further away from educational prices. -ERik Speckman
I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation is no help at all. As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-( There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows: C1 C2 S2 P2 P1 G The second bank is labeled "IRQ" and has the following labels: 5C 5S 4 3 3S 2C 2S I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the "G" enables the game port and the "S2" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t know how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! EBD --  Elliot Dierksen   "Is that a real poncho... I mean is that a Mexican poncho or                    is that a Sears  poncho?

The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window Manager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is. But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work without each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason, he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif, which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface. You cannot say "A Porsche looks like a VW Kfer" ONLY because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete different worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel at the same position as MS-W. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows client, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well? My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks.

Hi, I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone  claims..) Anyway.. 1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found  out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility..  But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use.. 2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ?? 3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8) 4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++)....  For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary... I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll  suspect not ..  5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????    As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls    0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on    entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given     conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to    screen memory in terms of portability? Many thanks.. Gotta go, bars closing soon 8) Cheers Ian 	
I've just installed a 5.25" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issues are the same.  So, to answer your questions... > My PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the > drive to an id# switch on the outside of the case.  Where do I connect > this switch??  Can the computer just "tell" with internal drives? You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put it at a convenient number like "1".  You *could* cut a hole in the back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of your internal drive. >	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I >didn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's >soldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems? Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM SIMMs, though. >	One last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?   >the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the >drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases).  Should I just >cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place? You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple dealer.  The relevant parts are:   922-0358  blank bezel faceplate   922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25" device mounting bracket] Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to mount a 5.25" device.  The service techs I talked to said, "Oh sure, we stock those."  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive. As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already cut out for a standard 5.25" device.  (Why not?  They advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 5.25" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use. I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my tape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device. Good luck with your SyQuest. 	-Fred
Jeff,   I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half a year and I love it.   Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only complaint was that they did not always return my calls.   I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's (800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know. -David **** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

Anyone have any ideas ??   I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns. But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it. Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...) --         Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels    Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!
My company has developed an application for the Mac that emulates a chart recorder - virtual pen traces scroll smoothly across the screen.  As we tested the application on a number of computers we discovered some surprising performance differences across products.  The scroll performance of the IIsi and LCII was better than the IIfx. This led us to investigate Color Quickdraw performance across the Apple line. The results: The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the (drumroll please) LCIII.  And the Color Classic ranks right up there with the Quadra line.  The Centris line pales in comparison. Does anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the disparity in graphics/processor performance? Xetron Corp. 40 W. Crescentville Road Cincinnati, Ohio 45246

>My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state >of CapsLock and/or NumLock is? I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th Keypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root window.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have been pressed. >An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X >keyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie, CapsLock is active, and the user >presses shift-a, I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'.

I'm writing an application running under X (using Motif), and I need to do some stuff when the application quits.  Now, when I shut down my X Windows session, it doesn't seem to send a SIGTERM (or whatever) signal to my application (I'm trapping various signals like that).  Therefore, I thought I could use an X signal to check for my top level window being destroyed. However I seem to get DestroyNotify events whenever I move windows.  Is there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed (some field to check or some combination of events?). Replies by e-mail please and I will summarise.

Hi all, I just got a La Cie 240 meg external hard drive.  Speed tests show that it's substantially faster that my internal 105 meg Quantum HD.  Supposedly the 105 and the 240 (both LPS drives) are roughly rated the same speed.  Why such a  large difference?

Hi there, We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11. Every once in a while, we run into "The Black Screen of Death", a phrase coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.   Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them. Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?   Is there a fix for it? Any response is welcome. Peter Sweeney

It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written Is that correct?

Presumeably, you mean without a _permanent_ swap file. If Windows needs a swap file, it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn't exist. Permanent is generally faster though. I don't know why Mathcad wouldn't be happy with either type--Ver. 3.0 is and so should any program conforming to the Win specification.

I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few weeks.  The plan I have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when I want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any compatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch without any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed and put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further reduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board. I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  Does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators?   Thanks.    <<< These statements are mine and not Boeing's >>>

Hi.  I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive.  I have the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work the other way around).  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a  floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves.  I am running MSDOS 6, and have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system files.  I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE controller cards.  If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except the booting part :)).  The system doesn't report an error message or anything, just hangs there.  Does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else run into a similar problem?  I was thinking that I might have to update the bios on one of the drives (is this possible?).  Any suggestions/answers would be greatly appreciated.  Please reply to: 	Jason Badry
Mornin' all.  I was wonderin'..... I got screenpeace (the screensaver, which I think is *very* good), and I got a problem with it... There is an option there, "realize colour table", and if it's switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with some screensavers (e.g. the "flashlight" one).  If I turn it off, however, it works well, and it's faster, so I have it off.  All's nice and well.  However, If I turn it off, then it will be on again next time I start windows.  All the setting are set in the win.ini file, and I *do* have "save settings on exit" selected. also, I tried manually changing the setting in the win.ini file to "n" (for no-->realize colour table), and started windows.  It will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again* turn the option on. I tried adding a +R (read-only) attribute to my win.ini file, and it worked, but my bitmap (wallpaper) saver didn't work then. Actually, it's the same application.  Anywya, it didn't work, since it must change the setting at the win.ini file. so anyone out there got any answers/suggesions/comments for me? thanks, i.a.

  QUESTION:   What is the EXACT entry (parameter and syntax please), in the X-Terminal configuration file (loaded when the X-Terminal boots), to add another system  to the TCP/IP access control list?      BACKGROUND:   I have two unix systems, 1. an AT&T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT's X11R4 and  2. a Sun SS10 without any X.     I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the same time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP Access Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!     I've tried to get "xhost" to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong or the X11R3 implementation is bogus.     I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the  NCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit, the NCD still boots with the TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2.   My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!  Thanks!

Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to Apple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's 160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode. Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up?? The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?); Macintosh LC to VGA   The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to 16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported to 256 colors.             inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work           with the Macintosh LC.   To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the pinout description for the adapter cable:   Macintosh LC        VGA Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name ---------------     ----    ----------- 1                   6       Red ground 2                   1       Red video signal 5                   2       Green video signal 6                   7       Green ground 9                   3       Blue video signal 13                  8       Blue ground 15                  13      /HSYNC 12                  14      /VSYNC 14                  10      HSYNC ground 7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together   VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC video connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA monitor. *************************************************************************** This message was created on MCW BBS a jointly supported by New Orleans Mac User Group & National Home & School User Group ***************************************************************************

We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over a serial line. I wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first Expose  event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to  receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server  round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program. Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program, available from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I  just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is "acceptable" interactive  response time. Has anyone got any ideas on this subject ? Thanks. --  +----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+ |Andrew Fielden.

I'm in the market for a laser printer. Used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following: Required features: - PostScript - 300 dpi - emough memory to download fonts - The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000. Nice things: - anything over 4 pages per minute - scsi output for a font disk - smallish footprint Don't Care About: - PostScript Level II - networking (its just for me, and always will be) - color I know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow. I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going to consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's experience with it, tho.  I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.  I'm a laser bigot and the first to admit it. :) I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable. Printers I've been looking at:   only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True? - Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee   discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably   cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning   towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint. - LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't   seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."   ?? - Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and   they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac? - I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.   Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),   but if its a decent printer I'll consider it. Thanks for any comments... --  ********************************************************* writer of trifles in shadows and blood *********************************************************

Hi, Experts,  I'm kind of new to X. The following question is strange to me. I am trying to modify the contents of the colormap but failed without reason (to me). I am using the following piece of code:   toplevel = XtInitialize(argv[0], "Testcolor", NULL, 0, 			  &argc, argv);   dpy = XtDisplay(toplevel);   scr = DefaultScreen(dpy);   def_colormap = DefaultColormap(dpy,scr);   if(XAllocColorCells(dpy, def_colormap, True, NULL, 0, cells, 5)) {     color.pixel = cells[0];     color.red = 250;     color.green = 125;     color.blue = 0;     color.flags = DoRed | DoGreen | DoBlue;     XStoreColor(dpy, def_colormap, &color);     printf("\n Try to allocate, the color %d as (%d,%d,%d)", 	   color.pixel, color.red, color.green, color.blue);      XQueryColor(dpy, def_colormap, &color);     printf("\n After  allocate, the color %d is (%d,%d,%d)", 	   color.pixel, color.red, color.green, color.blue);    }   else Running output:      Try to allocate, the color 7 as (250,125,0)      After  allocate, the color 7 is (0,0,0) After XStoreColor(), XQueryColor() just returned the original value.  No failure/error displayed but the contents of colormap are obvious unchanged. (I also tried to draw a line using the colors but it  turned out to be the unmodified colors.) So what is my problem? How to modify the contents of the colormap? Any help/information will be appreciated.

One solution, sometimes, is to disable "blind writes" >  To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16sec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can "hiccup" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back. Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn't crash the machine... Clinton Bauder Apple Computer

Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation. (w/o permission.  I hope that is ok) Jose Bad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for Apple Macintosh PowerBook Duos)  MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132. COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993 By Raines Cohen      Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss and other problems.      Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM products from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify. Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.      > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called selfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with nonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to wake from sleep.      Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part number stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips instead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may not tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses nonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed while the Duo sleeps.      > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo cards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology Works said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.      Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers Duo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is compatible with the slower chips.      > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that some third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally when in a Duo Dock.      Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it originally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all customers free upgrades to cards that fit.

This happens with every icon editor including the image editor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP files either; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is with the icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the file with a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing the colormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I can fix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem?  Thanks. -- Sadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Center for Reliable and High-performance Computing

Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50. My computer configuration is : 486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz) 16MB Ram ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk, SCSI UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark, I get a Harddisk data transfer about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec.  Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read, that some host  adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk  performance in that system, do I need that ? A guy I know, gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec, and he has an ST3283A and a ISA 486DX-50, how can a ISA with the same system be faster ? Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?                                         Thanks. Working on a sign...... "Are we live or on tape ??"
Software that comes together with the VideoBlaster is designed to work together with the SoundBlaster (from the same manufacturer). to use the PC Speaker driver to play audio files for the VideoBlaster (.AVI = audio video interleave files) ? I think what I should have is a device driver for the Media Player that controls the PC Speaker Driver instead of the SoundBlaster card (something like MCISPKR.DRV). Has anybody heard of such a driver? Or am I on the wrong track? Any information on this appreciated!

I have a toggleButton widget (yes widget) and I have a routine which changes the color of the foreground and background of the label.  Well, the background changes alright, but the label text does not redraw itself. I am guessing that I have to force it to redraw with an XExposeEvent sent to it via XSendEvent.  Is this the best way to get the text up again?  I can't seeem to get XSEndEvent to work right.... if this is a good approach, might anyone have an example lying around to show me how to do this?  I've RTFM all evening and did not find a decent example. PS I keep getting Segmentation Faults in XSEndEvent, tho all the values are as expected. Thanks in Advance Stephen M. Dahmen

I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text. I want it to be of fixed width, but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point visible. In trying to do this I have two problems:  - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget    taller, but instead it seems to cover part of the text.  - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text    in order to keep the insertion point visible. Any help is appreciated.

As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space. The limit that causes the message, "Windows will only use ...," is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts. In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter: 	PageOverCommit=multiplier The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit: 	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of 	linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is 	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to 	the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value 	specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the 	amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data 	structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity 	proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a 	value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry, 	you must edit SYSTEM.INI. -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories

Have you tried re-creating it by either 1.exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar is visible, or 2.double clicking on the Control menu(the one with minimize and maximize in in) when everything looks proper? If you have, and it still doesn't work, you may want to delete your winfile.ini and try one of these two saving procedures again to totally recreate the file from scratch. Good luck!

First of all, thanks to those of you who responded, both here and via e-mail. The tips didn't pan out, but it was good hearing from you. Now, following up to my earlier post: [...] : Disk controller:  Acculogic sIDE-3 2 hard/2 floppy IDE controller :     Normal IRQ*/delayed IRQ     Primary*/secondary floppy address :     Single*/dual speed floppy   Primary*/secondary IDE address :     Precomp = 125ns*/187 ns     IOCHRDY not driven*/IDE drive controls IOCHRDY [...] : Other cards:  (didn't check brand) 2 Serial/1 Parallel adapter : 	      Logitech Bus Mouse adapter : 	      Roland MPU-401-compatible MIDI interface  : 		Configured with default IRQ 2, mem address 0330 I opened up the box and removed all the "other cards" above.  No help there. Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put  everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards. I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!, the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds  before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns. O.K., with this additional information, does anyone in netland have any  words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it? -Larry "still (un)plugging away" Byler-
I have a Logitech 2S-2f (or 2f-2S) 2-button mouse that I want to interface to a serial port of a different (non-ibm-compatible) system. The mouse is XT/AT/PS2 compatible, with a DB25 connector.  I tried to reverse engineer the mouse, but it has a micro-controller inside it. If I could get the DB25 pin-out, and perhaps a copy of the BIOS routines that support it, I could map all this into my target system? Anyone know where I might get the pin-out or the BIOS routines? Are the routines published someplace convenient? Thanks! Silvio PS....please send email to me directly!

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda. Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well. They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory, and some stuff about comms.    The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and  X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching. The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course. Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not! 								Mackem Ian.
A quick query for Powerbook gurus: Tom Spearman, in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options mentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140-180 batteries: a 2.5 amp hour one (M5545/A), a 2.8 amp hour one, (M5545/B) and a 2.9 amp hour one (M5545/C). Anyone out there know how to determine which of these a battery is? I looked at my battery and there is no obvious exterior indication. I contacted Tom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he didn't know either. Anyone out there know the answer? 	Thanks!

In practice, they are not." >"You mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision > revised?!?!" All right.  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give  your question a shot.  The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying. My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.   The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many...... Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first. Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like  a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not  as impressive.   So, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?
Keywords:  These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions. 1.  If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a  modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated (non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all  O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of  the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier  requirements. 2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/left sides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window  manager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone who has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move and seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border. Any help would be most appreciated. Darcy

Hello,  I have a Hayes 9600 moden with no cables or manuals.  The modem requires a source of 14V AC, but I do not know how to connect the power source to the 3 pin connector.  I know that the top pin is the ground, so I would guess that the other two are the AC pins, right?  If you have any hints, please E-Mail me, I really need help...  Thanks!!!  Duc N.

> >Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an >Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look >like?   The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode, which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800 does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s), since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip. Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using standard palette.   BTW if anyone is insterested, I'm trying to sell a Diamond Viper (2 megs vram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (I'm too broke to take it myself). >Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?   I think it's available in limited quantites.  No idea of what VGA chip it uses though.   Be very careful with OEM P9000 boards though, the Orchid I got for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as  documentation, and conflicts the hell with my VLB controller  card (or maybe it's my motherboard, an A.I.R. 486 VLB) +----------------------------------------------------------------+ Stephen Lau, Elec.

  Can someone out there tell me how to switch Window's screen resolution quickly and easily?  I know that I can go back into install to do it, but what I'd really like is to have is the ability to just change a couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution changed.

Hi, I just got XFree86 running on my pc with Consensys and encountered a few minor (I hope) probems. The pc is hooked up to a LAN where I want remote X applications to  connect to my X-server.  I believe the command to permit this is xhost.  When I'm logged on my pc and type 'xhost + '  ,  I get the error message saying "You must be on local machine to enable access".  what does this mean ?  ain't I already on the local machine? Another problem I have is with the mouse movement.  I find that the  mouse cursor moves extremely slow and choppy. How can I make the mouse cursor move more accurately? thank in advance. Any help is much appreciated. Christy

Hello duo owners (and Apple technical people :-)   I have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from sleep when running on battery power. When woken (usually for the second time) after sleeping, the wake fails and the screen appears with a corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of the machine. The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard (no extensions, no virtual memory, a fully charged new battery, system 7.1 etc). I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC. I've checked that the battery is properly seated (it appears to be fine).   What's going on here ? Anyone else had this problem ? Is it software or hardware ?    If you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedly sleeping and waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same behaviour (and let Apple know too !).   Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me.   Bruce --  ***complex problems have straight forward, easy to understand wrong answers***
Hi, I've got a Victor PC/XT with a 20 MB harddisk in it. The controller is a Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector. There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wires and another with 34 wires. The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire bus. Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus) How can I solve my problem, any suggestions? --Bas.
	IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAERE TYPIST PLUS GRAPHICS 	HAND SCANNER, PLEASE READ ON AND SAVE MY LIFE......... My problem is that my Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will not connect to my PowerBook 160. The cable from the scanner will not fit the SCSI port of the computer.  I managed to gaet a cabled assembled that adapted the cord to the computer. However, this placed the computer into SCSI mode, that is it acted as an external hard disk whenever i switched the computer on. I've asked an engineer in London to assemble a new Cable for me. But he's taken 14 weeks and has yet to find the solution, out of sheer laziness. And I know that a cable exists to solve the problem. If you know the solution. Please let me know what cable I need and how I can get hold of one.  My E-Mail address is : I will be truely grateful for all your help. Thanking you in advance, Zia.
Is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the WINHELP.EXE file? I have recently noticed some unusual system behavior and ran Norton AntiVirus for WINDOWS.

I've pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because I have the same requirements you do......and the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers don't accept mice at any but com1 and com2 using irq4 or irq3 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has them.....I've talked to Mouse Systems who say their driver doesn't support other than com1 and com2 as above , but who claim to be releasing one that will SOON!??. The other alternative seems to be possible, but in one case prohibitively expensive, i.e. 4 port card for $600??????!!, and in the other, the author(s) of PowerBBS for Windows claim to have a 4 port serial card with buffered 16550 UARTS and drivers for windows to match (i.e. com3 irq5) for $120...... The second paragraph is hearsay, because I haven't checked it out yet.....but intend to as soon as I can free up $120 <g> Hope this will save you some steps.

Hello I have recently suffered from various problems concerning an Adaptec 1542A controller. Problem 1: Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they  are located. Problem 2: My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe) I get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers. Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?

I have a Gateway 4DX-33V with my 3.5 inch floppy as drive A.  I accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up, rather than getting the "Non-system diskette" message, the machine hangs and the CMOS gets overwritten (luckily, Gateway sends a print of the standard CMOS settings with their systems).  This only happens with a box of pre-formatted Fuji disks that I have, no other disks cause this problem.  If I re-format one of the Fuji disks, the problem goes away. I did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing. Anyone have any idea what is going on here?  Hardware problem?  A virus that can't be detected?  The system reading in garbage from the boot sector? --

Hi, The subject line says it all.  My system acts weird at times.  All of a sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc. This was a really big problem for a while.  I couldn't even format my drive properly.  I installed HDT's driver and things got better.  Now all I have to do is reinstall the system.  Could an incompatibility  exist between it and a Quantum external drive. I'm looking for a pure hardware solution.  It's not a virus, bad software, etc.  Could I have a bad SCSI cable?  Or is the IBM (WDS-80) just a screwey drive? Thanks, Chuck --  Chuck Williams ==> CS Intern ==> Pacific Northwest Laboratories

I've never had quicken but I did use MYM in it's early days. I have MS Money for Windows now and a financial planning package called Wealthbuilder by Reality Technologies and Money Magazine. P.S. I also do my taxes with Turbo Tax. All of these packages are good in their own way but none of them really support me in doing what I really need to do - manage my finances. The first company that comes along with a Windows based package that:     manages budgets and accounts     manages loans     calculates taxes     uses all of the above and knowledge about my investing philosophy to       help me invest in the right investment vehicles, and     integrates it all together will have my business for life.

Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts, I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different color maps for different windows, and I've been having trouble getting the window manager to reliably honor my requests.  In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating. I would dearly appreciate   1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window   a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;   2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my   desired colormaps. By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything reasonable or imaginable. Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING* to do this.  Please, please, please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing wrong/how to do it right!!! Yours, Chris Lee /***********************************************************************/ Display* dpy;  /* DECLARE SOME DATA... */ Colormap popup_cmap; XColor mycolor; Window win; XSetWindowAttributes cwa; int nwlist; Window *wlist; /* NB: FOR BREVITY, NOT SHOWING ALL CODE LINES--JUST A SCHEMATIC */ popup_cmap=XCreateColormap(dpy,DefaultRootWindow(dpy),vis->visual,AllocAll); /* HERE WE STORE A BUNCH OF COLORS USING    XStoreColor(dpy,popup_cmap,&mycolor); ... */ cwa.colormap = popup_cmap; win = XCreateWindow(dpy, parent, x, y, w, h,                     borderWidth, vis->depth, InputOutput, vis->visual,                     CWColormap|CWBorderPixel, &cwa); /* LIST ALL SUB WINDOWS OF my_topwin, PARENT OF win, INTO wlist;    nwlist IS COUNTER OF ENTRIES IN wlist.    NB: wlist is static storage that can be relied on not to go away        or be corrupted.  I thought of that!

I'm writing 'xwall', a simple X version of 'wall', and I want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays.  The problem is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm (login screen).   I've been through the manuals and FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable' ahead of time, or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short period of time.  Any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info?  Thanks... --  _______________________________________________________________________________ "You could say I've lost faith in the politicians/  They all seem like game show hosts to me..."          - Sting
>I have a peculiar color problem with MacX, Apple's Macintosh X server. >I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem.

It doesn't happen >for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some >Motif clients. I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap. It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look ugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications are having to make do with it's colormap. This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap. My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color (if this is an option for the application).  - Doug Shaker 	voice:	415/572-0200 	fax:	415/572-1300 	mail:	Qualix Group 		1900 S.

The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory access). >HSK --  Ravikumar Venkateswar A pun is a no' blessed form of whit.

> <reference to running ATI's Install Program and using >  its functions to position/size images at various >  resolutions> I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is necessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the standard selections.  For this reason, I use the "factory defaults" for position/size on the ATI card and adjust each mode individually (only the first time) at the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings the next time each mode is "detected". --  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common GUI. But what does this mean exactly?  - Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will have the Motif   look and feel? - Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will use the Motif   toolkit API? - Do they mean both of the above? - Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with   an OpenLook Look & Feel? - How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F?   (I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?) - Will there be more than one "standard" toolkit API or L & F supported? - How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif? This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much  knowledge about these questions off the net...

I'm thinking about getting a Toshiba 3401 CD-ROM and hooking it up through the SCSI port on a Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum sound board. Does anybody have this configuration out there?  If so, does it work? For anybody in general who has the Toshiba 3401 CD-ROM drive, have you had any hadware problems?  Door not opening, scratched disks, door not closing (getting stuck or not closing all the way), CD holder jamming and any other CD related problems. Thanks in Advance Mark

Any advice or suggestions will be   |> appreciated. |>  |> Thanks, |> Mike A professor of mine once said "The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist is about $5000" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than the CS. Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the "computer" in your car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE.  These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is. P.S. The $5000 is not just a joke Scott

As described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization of the S3 card. InitDisplay; 	(*BIOS-Call 		with AX-Reg = 4F02H 		with BX-Reg = 105H for 1024 x 768 x 256 resolution 		Interrupt 10H *) Unlock Register Lock 1 (CR38) 	(* For access to S3 Register Set *) Unlock Register Lock 2 (CR39) 	(* For access to Syst. Control and Syst. Extension Register *) Unlock Graphic Command Group (CR40) 	(* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Syst. Configuration Register *) Unlock Advanced Display Functions 	(* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Function Control Register *) After these operations the FIFO-stack of the S3 should be empty. When we watch the status (Graph. Proc. Status), we always get the value 0FH instead of 0H. Full would mean 0FFH (8 places occupied), empty would mean 0H (0 places occupied). It is possible to read this register in two different ways.  Both times we get different results. Our machine is a 486 DX/2 with EISA bus and a S3 86C805 local bus.  --> any ideas?

>> >> >>Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C650 regarding >>fpu?  In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C650 has the message "fpu: >>optional".  I know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all >>C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80 configuration.  Why would >>they be so unclear about this issue in their price list?     I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't. >>I'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting >>confused with whether it comes with fpu or not.     Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an FPU. >>Why say "optional" if it's built in?     Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th. >If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with >a 68RC040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support.  My  >understanding is that the "optional fpu" refers to your option of purchasing >the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU.       This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION. >Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU >system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system >(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor.     This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full 040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040. >Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY >comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU - >the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot >swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).     They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040. -Hades
Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped myself and a few others: What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large cache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs? EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?).  Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into the SIMM RAM cache? I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM accesses? Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci system described in the EX above. --patrick

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst   By your OWN data the "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI" is correct With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed "20% faster than IDE" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on  sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as  mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)} Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip an Apple salesperson said "it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip" {Not at a 6MB/s, 10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}. Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on. One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is  (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).

It sounds like something/one may have set the 1000's separator to "." in Contol Panel (under International).  This makes 23,482 look like 23.482 and File Manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of the file size. 3,356,345 becomes 3.356.345, and again, File Manager is confused by the decimal points where there should be commas, chopping off everything to the right of the first period. --  a.k.a.

There's really no simple way to tell this is the case. You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool. You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources. Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit()  regularly.
This is the 2nd Reguest for Discussion ( RFD ) for the creation of  comp.databases.ms-access  The discussion period started on April 6 and it will last until April 28, ( 22 days ). This is an official RFD for the creation of a new newsgroup for the general discussion of the Microsoft Access RDMS. NAME: COMP.DATABASES.MS-ACCESS MODERATION: UNMODERATED. At this time, no need for a moderator has been assertained. Future evaluation will determine if one is needed. PURPOSE:  Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System. It includes WYSIWYG design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a database programming language called Access Basic. THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's  WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use  Access Basic to create complex databases. RATIONALE: Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical Development enviroment and its initial low price. Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices. For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss  their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions. --  Napoleon

Hi.  I am having some interesting problems with my Boca graphics card, which  is based on the Cirrus Logic chipset (I am not sure exactly which one).  The problem is as follows: If I use any Windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64K-colour driver (ie 16 colour or 256 colour), the image on screen becomes too tall - no amount of resizing on the monitor will make it fit.  And if I use Excel with the 64K- colour driver, it hangs as soon as it loads.  Anyone out there used this card/experienced anything similar. Please reply by mail, and I will post any solutions here.

Hi there, I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1.  I have a 286 with a GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers. I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen. The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly. Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc. The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again. If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine. I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail. Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled! Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction! Linda Cornell UW Office of Research
Does anyone know the difference between MOOLIT and OLIT?  Does Sun support MOOLIT?  Is MOOLIT available on Sparcstations?

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window  or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window.  The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command: 		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the  command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.] 	Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent. 	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders  XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z. 	A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information:  from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z. 	To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for  use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output. 	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities. 	Also:  2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter. 	ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and  non-PostScript printers. 	Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows)  include session managers or other desktop programs which include "print portion of screen" or "take a snapshot" options. Some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example,  have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals  have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer. 	Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct  support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	If you need color PostScript in particular, you can  	- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color  PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv  	- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick  distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider  instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++  Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting  among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps,  gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z. 	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in  particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22). 	Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are  later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.   Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;  see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93. can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF,  GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity,  contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned  formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on  it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92;  see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z,  and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z. and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images. 	The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar  to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,  weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*. 	Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential  interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is  a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and  Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif,  xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications. export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included. 	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions. is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package  also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar. 	A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell: 		echo "ESC]2;TEXT^G" where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed, and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character). 	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories: 		alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G' 	The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name  used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the  icon name. the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself. a ^V. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file  ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z. O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control  sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of  the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93] Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a  compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100  sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was  published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter). In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do. [last updated 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to  "stty pass8" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as  	XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 	XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.] In addition, you may want to set this in your shell: 	setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1         For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with  the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (')  is Alt-'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give  a resource specification like this: 		xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size.  But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly: 		xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.  manipulating the selection will help; e.g.  	% xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a  window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export. 	Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be adapted to do this. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and  XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for  application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. 	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a  way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also  have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could  set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up  app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): 	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see  XtResolvePathname()):         %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                 application's class name.         %T      The value of the file "type".  In this case, the                 literal string "app-defaults"         %C      customization resource (R5 only)         %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.         %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")         %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja")         %t      The territory part of the display's language string         %c      The codeset part of the display's language string 	Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is  "Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the  example omits locale-specific lookup.) 	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm 	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm 	As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above  app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it  and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to  search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin. 	Let's consider another example. This time, let's set  XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working  directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. 	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N 	The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands  to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file  Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless. 	With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization  resource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application like this: 	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color" 	If one of your pathname specifications had the value "/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be "/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource. 	The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is: 		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ 		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ 		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N this batch of default settings.) 	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is  		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) 		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) 		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5) 		<root>/%L/%N:\ 		<root>/%l/%N:\ 		<root>/%N: 	<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory  if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other  than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether. 	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR  to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3  compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to "./", a dot followed  by a slash. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example,  your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line  	DisplayManager.0.authorize: false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also  	DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of: 	#!/bin/sh 	#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources 	/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap 	/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a  general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your  .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with "#!/bin/csh".  	If this doesn't work, also try starting off with: 		#!/bin/sh 		# Reset path: 		PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	There are several ways to avoid having to do a "setenv DISPLAY ..." whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X. 	One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It  includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar. 	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then  propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain 		eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special  format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables. [11/90] 	In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on  another host, and you find 		rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY  too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be  		xrsh <HOST> xterm   #! /bin/sh   # start an X11 process on another host   #   # An improved version:   #   # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.  This   # script combines the best of both.      case $# in   [01])  echo "Usage: $0 host x-cmd [args...]";;   *)   	case $SHELL in   	*csh*)  host="$1"; shift   		xhost "$host" > /dev/null   		rsh "$host" -n \   			"setenv TERM xterm; setenv DISPLAY `hostname`:0; \   			exec $* </dev/null >& /dev/null" &   		;;   	*sh)   		host="$1"; shift   		xhost "$host" > /dev/null   		rsh "$host" -n \   			"TERM=xterm export TERM; \   			DISPLAY=`hostname`:0 export DISPLAY; \   			LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11/lib export LD_LIBRARY_PATH; \   			PATH=\$PATH:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/bin; \ 			export PATH; \   			exec $* < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1" &   		;;   	esac   	;;   esac ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	One way is to use the "bitmap" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual  characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate  them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X  Journal for more information. 	The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained  a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor. 	An easier way is to use the "xfed" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63],  possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers. 	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed  [5/91] in export:/contrib.  	If you are a MetaFont user you can use "mftobdf" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu. 	The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats. 	The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font. 	Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler,  installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp  $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the  directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably  leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in  the path.) 	Sometimes your "xset +fp $dir" command fails with a BadValue error: 		X Error of failed request:BadValue 			(integer parameter out of range for operation) 		Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath) 	This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an "integer parameter" in the message is spurious.) -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file    system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your    font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. "xset +fp ~/myfonts") and    the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm. -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server    (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file    "fonts.dir".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're    running OpenWindows, look for the file "Families.list".  If you can't find    it, run bldfamily(1).) -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for    example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.

If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work    for X11Rn. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	A tool called "snftobdf 1.4" is part of the bdftools package, which is  available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from  crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and  produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be  used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can  understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools  such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail  	In addition, the R5 program "fstobdf" can produce bdf for any font that the R5 server has access to. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation, but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file  contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is  for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for  creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers  which do not use the MIT font scheme. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the ".pcf" format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I want to be able to do something like this: 	xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave 	You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because  of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore,  neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap  converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets, however. However: 	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick  image formats as a pixmap. 	The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used  by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM  distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on  the R5 contrib tape.

If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list,  you can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh,  "send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq". ---------------------------------------------------------------------- After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no other clients are able to connect to it. 	The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least) delete "old" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which  contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add "! -type s" to the find exclusion in the cron job.

It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z .   The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and  Type-5 keyboards.

Subject: >>>WANTED: Your opinions on the Insight Talon TA-1000 or TA-2000 Multimedia kits<<< For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution      Network, Inc. and their Multimedia Kits: I'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which is bundled with the CD-ROM drive with 265-280ms access time, 300Kb dtr, multispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16 sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC (280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!). Other questions: - Excuse my ignorance, but is "Texel" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM   market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive? - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the   TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000) Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff, educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit. Basically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably directly to the email address below.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O. Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators. One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code. Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year. First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order. By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now. Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.

>In the MacUser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned >that the C650 and the Q800, and not the C610, had ROM accelerated video. > >What is it?  I don't recall seeing it in Dale Adams post. of course it was in Dale's post, just not in the words that MacUser  used.  ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands has been rewritten (inside the ROM) to take advantage of the 68040 addressing modes.  commands that do fills should be slightly faster since the new instructions fetch 2 bytes at a time versus one.
Subject: * What's the difference between a Mac Portable and Powerbook 100? I've been looking into getting a portable Mac to do some work and I've had my eye on the PB 100. Lately, I've been seeing people with the old portables, and they're selling for $300 LESS that the PB 100s. What I want to know is: what are the differences between them? All I know is that the Portable is heavier, but the PB100 doesn't have an internal drive. Here's what I NEED to know: Does the portable support Appletalk/network connections? What's the CPU inside a Portable? (68000?) DOES THE PORTABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM 7????????? What's the maximum memory capacity of the Portable? Can you still get 	RAM (meaning: does it use special SIMMS?) What kind of internal HD does it use? Does the Portable have a better screen?

The last time I was in microprocessor lab was in 1980, using Z-80. So I don't know a lot of buzz terms in PC hardware. Now I need to purchase a 486, help me to ask the right questions. Motherboard:     I need 486-33 with 8 MB ram, with additonal slot for 8 more MB.     I would like to get two VESA Local Bus. One for video, not sure     what am I going to do with the other.      It must be able to run Unix.          What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a     quality stuff? What are other important features ? Monitor:     I want a 14" non interlaced svga, but not sure about what brand     to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider?     Acer? Touch?     What else should I ask? Video Card:      I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western     Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of      V-RAM?     One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal?      Hard Drive:     Segate, Western Digital, Conner all have the same price. Which one is     more liable? which one has better performace? Case/power supply:     Given the choise of desktop and minitower, which one is better?     What is the adequate power supply?     Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue?     What features should I ask for?      Did I miss anything? I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group. Your help is greatly appreciated. Jason Chen

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way to go about this:     static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {         {             XtWidgetBaseOffset,             (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),             sizeof(CoreWidget)         }     };     XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,                             parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL ); However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it says that I can add it to a widget's "class_intialize" function. HOW? What's one of those? :-( If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure this is a FAQ. Thanks in advance, Rik.

Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought I would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length). To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on. 	1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case. 	2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables, 		spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out. 	3. Remove the flopy drive. 	4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting 		the supply straight up and out. 	5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom 		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out. 	6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and 		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then 		lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the 		board must be removed first) 	7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules). 		This is not easy even for a skilled solderer. 	8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins 		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers. 	9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder  		them in. 	10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock. 	11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and  		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and 		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a 		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole 		in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using 		insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat 		sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure. 	12. Put it all back together and go-for-it. 	    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will 	    void your warentee.

Hello, I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent, a unix clone OS for Intel architecture machines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple terminal emulator program). The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the  rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the  rightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual characters. If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to find it, it would be much appreciated. Regards and thanks, Jon Dhuse. --   Intel  Corp.

Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless. I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W. Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!! Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character?  Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF? --                                                                          ____  Deakin University, School of Engineering & Technology, Geelong, Australia \/

I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something much more elementary. Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and an initial directory. If you have a small disk (50 meg or less), I would recommend that it remain a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration. If you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg), multiple partitions can make sense. -- 
I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your message, but I definitely had SCSI problems between my Q700 and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive 10 cartridge drives.

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy, and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+
HI there!  I have a few games that I'd like to run under Windows 3.1 and can't get the PIFS adjusted right.   For example Wing Commander.  In my DOS Prompt, I have more than 620K available for programs.  This is enough to run WC. So I build a PIF giving WC a couple of megs of extended memory etc.. and run  it.  WC prompts: "Loading Wing Commander..." and then a message about  "Using extended memory..." etc... and then my screen goes black (just before the opening scene-the orchestra-would have appeared.) I also have a pool game that does almost the same thing.  It opens up and prompts me for what kind of video driver I have.  (CGA, EGA, etc...)  I respond EGA and the screen goes black.    On both of these a ctrl-alt-del getss me back to Windows.   Has ANYONE run Wing Commander under Windows?  Or has had the problems I describe and fixed them?

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.   First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months. The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections. Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup. Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day.  In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends. Let me know if you have any more questions. Peter Hansen Bell Northern Research

The Quantum LPS 240AT is supposed to have a 256K cache on the IDE controller built into the card.  Yet when I do a DOS DIR command on my system, the disk is always accessed (I can hear the mechanical movement of the heads).  Why is this happening?  Strangely, even when I have smartdrive installed, every DIR command accesses the disk.  Did I somehow de-activate the cache?  This is happening on each  of two machines with an LPS 240AT drive. --

At this time, no need for a moderator has been assertained. Future evaluation will determine if one is needed. PURPOSE:  Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System. It includes WYSIWYG design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a database programming language called Access Basic. THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's  WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use  Access Basic to create complex databases. RATIONALE: Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical Development enviroment and its initial low price. Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices. For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss  their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions. --  Napoleon
Okay, I'm trying to install NCSA telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch) of machines.  They're all true blue IBMs with either Fallon Phonenet cards or Dastar cards.  (I belive those names are correct.)  Well, the docs for telnet say that it'll run over an AppleTalk driver, but I've had little success. If anyone has succesfully installed Telnet w/ AppleTalk, I'd like some help with the config file for Telnet... BTW, please reply via E-mail if possible...

| I would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on IDE Controllers. | I would liek to get a IDE controller card for my VLB DX2 66 Motherboard. | What are good options for this (preferably under $200). It MUST also work | under OS/2 and be compatible with Stacker (and other Disk Compression S/W). I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller, although my machine is DX2/66 VLB. I has the save transfer rate of 0.647 MB/s regardless of the variations of the ISA bus speed. I tested it with speed between 5.5MHz and 8.33MHz. Not _any_ difference. The problem is not the interface between the controller and the memory. My advice: Buy 4Megs of RAM, save $70 and enjoy performance. --

Subject: ### 68040 25Mz FOR SALE : ABSOLUTELY NEVER USED ### I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get a good enough offer.  It is still in its static free sealed package. If I don't get a good enough offer, I will use it to replace my 68LC040. Any takers?   Supposedly you can get one of these for $375.  However, at the moment the demand is higher than the supply so I think $400 is a good round number. I will pay shipping, of course.
>>Can anyone tell me if this card works with the March OS/2 2.1 beta? > > I believe so, since the Buslogic cards have proven to be very  >reliable in OS/2 2.0.... > The BusLogic cards have an OS/2 2.0 driver that does work with the March 2.1 beta. Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer. If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!)  So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and REM out the Adaptec drivers. Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the right order.. it will work. Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun.  The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS. Hope this helps.. - Dan --  ****************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700 upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21" with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.   If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an accelerator. Paul

I am considering making a reasonably large application for free distribution (probably copylefted).  I am going to use X.  Now I'm bewildered by the huge number of "standards" that "open systems" has created.   I've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools here were produced with the Athena Widget set, or X Intrinsics or Xw (??).   In my humble opinion, they look like crap.  I don't know, however, if this is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste in the programmers. I would like my app to look a little more "sculptured" like mwm.  I understand, however, that mwm isn't free like the other tookits. I am getting Linux, so I will have InterViews, but I don't know how it will look.  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF, but I don't know what it looks like either. If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, I would be much obliged.  Which are free?  Which are the best?  Which are portable?  Which looks nice?  Which is not a resource hog? Also, if you happen to know which are available on Linux and/or Sun, that would be a big help too. Thanks in advance.
This may be a dumb question, but I need to put a hard drive on my father's PC/XT, either MFM, RLL, or IDE. I know how to hook it up, but how do I tell the computer the geometry of the drive. On my 386, you set it in the BIOS, but I doubt that's how it's done on an XT. I thought it might be software with the controller card, but the IDE card for XT's that I saw didn't come with any. Also, how do I low level format it once it's on the computer? (Assuming a drive which needs formatting) advTHANKSance, Rob

Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended swapfile".  I'll quote the information   If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you   will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything   larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we   will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount   of RAM on your machine. So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew. Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130. That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself I sprang for Word. Well, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money. And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products. I need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-) Thanks, Brent Casavant
Windows Shareware Monthly (WSM) is an on-line forum for information about the newest and best Windows 3.x and NT shareware/freeware software.  WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc. WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information. Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner: 1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version, where the software is available,    how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any    special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the    author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the    summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,    indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's    Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.  3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text. 4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.   5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version). 6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:        if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP    file, then e-mail to:    DiegoAA 7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries. WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.   Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints. WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.

I have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler   built into the motherboard. I want to add a SCSI drive (a quantum prodrive   425F 425 MG formatted). I have no documentation at all and I need your   help! As I understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive.  Could you   please tell me if I'm right.. 1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are   kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want   it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on   the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the   adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the   quantum? 2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable. Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and   all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive. 3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type   of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive. 4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I   think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with   SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual   (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want   the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this? Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting?  Any help is *really* appreciated, I'm lost... -Eric
I have a 286 with an M205 motherboard.  The Last Byte memory manager (which I downloaded for a trial) reports the chipset is an AddTech PCCHIP1 chipset, and it is able to activate the ram behind segments A000-FFFF, which can then be used for UMBs (except for video/BIOS).  I would like to write my own driver to activate the memory.  Does anyone know where I can get programming information on this chip? Phil

I'm in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix 1.10 (got a new hard disk, discovered my BIOS doesn't have a "type 47") and I would like know where I can purchase one of these things. I checked with the motherboard manufacturer (for the curious-- it's from Mylex), and hearing the $60 figure prompted me to at least try to shop around... Problem is, I don't know where to shop around for something like this. I have heard that there's a BIOS speciality shop in the South Bay and it's been alleged that they advertise in the MicroTimes. Did find the MicroTimes, didn't find the ad or the shop. So, can anybody help me out on this quest? To anybody who replies to this-- Thanks in advance. -Jeff Chan					| These are my opinions.

I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code > mentioned above...   There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution.   Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.   The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).   Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).   In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.

Could someone please tell me what a  LaserWriter IINTX upgrade kit is. Its a small box, which has a bag inn it , seemingly containing 6 chips (look like ROMS) and a IINTX manual. The installation instructions are most informative and say, in full, "This product must be installed by an Apple ........." SO what does this do ? At first I thought it might be a NT to NTX upgrade, but I thought that required an entirely new board. Any info appreciated. Doug.
: What has this got to do with comp.windows.x? :  I agree that this is a side track, but it is funny that I skip so many other articles (threads) but I couldn't resist reading this one. My beliefs, opinions, and expressions are strictly my own and do not represent or reflect any official or unofficial policies or attitudes of any other person or organization....   but.  I have heard that Ford Motor Company has (had) a recruiting bias toward engineers and away from computer science graduates.  The reasoning is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements.  This is evidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contracts and are not brought on board except in special circumstances.  This is a generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true, but there are statistics.  Furthermore, most "software engineering" at Ford gets done by electrical engineers.  I know of 2 univerities that have merged the computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming. But since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted imagination I suppose I should keep it to myself.

It is the same price as the stealth card. Plus it is also based on S3 928 chip the newest and fastest chip from s3.  Everyone, if you are looking for a card, SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINE FOR THEIR REVIEW.   They noted this person's problem with dos. The stealth card is not a very good dos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local bus). It got glowing reports from the magazine (was a best buy) and I called them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week! They have a bulletin board to get the latest drivers.  Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400.  AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 928 class (based on the winmark results). If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check out the actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557. P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie: games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip (ie: stealth and actix cards.) They have "comparable" windows performance and are cheaper to buy. Eric

I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230 ([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems. Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away (For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged configuration. He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these have helped.  It's possible that it's network-related, he uses Eudora which checks his email every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He hasn't checked to see if this problem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time).  Little to no non-Apple inits, I don't want to start yanking the rest unless I know that might *really* be the problem.  He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.

A reasonably accurate prediction... Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files: There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards. The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now. The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a "magic" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file. The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in "chunks" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated. To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file. CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it "fixes". Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem: >C:\GFX\VPIC46\CVPIC.EXE >C:\GFX\VPIC46\VPIC.TXT >C:\GFX\VPIC46\VIDEO7.CFG >C:\GFX\VPIC46\ORCPRO2.CFG >C:\GFX\VPIC46\VGA.CFG >C:\GAME\GOOSE\BIRD2.X >C:\WINMISC\ADV21\WINADV.EXE >   Allocation error, size adjusted All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.)) >   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains. >    647168 bytes disk space would be freed Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these "lost chains" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked "available" in the FAT. >C:\GFX\VPIC46\CVPIC.EXE >   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 ... >C:\386SPART.PAR >   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file... To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will "fix" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  "Missing pieces" are likely to be found in those "lost chains" at the top...) >  42366976 bytes total disk space >   3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files >    153600 bytes in 67 directories >  36042752 bytes in 1496 user files >   1564672 bytes available on disk Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space... In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.  Sorry. --  ---------------------------------------------------- Vote straight ticket Procrastination party Dec. 3rd! --  ---------------------------------------------------- Vote straight ticket Procrastination party Dec. 3rd!
Anybody seen the date get stuck? I'm running MS-DOS 5.0 with a menu system alive all the time.  The machine is left running all the time. Suddenly, the date no longer rolls over.  The time is (reasonably) accurate allways, but we have to change the date by hand every morning.  This involves exiting the menu system to get to DOS. Anyone have the slightest idea why this should be?  Even a clue as to whether the hardware (battery? CMOS?) or DOS is broken? --  voice: 805-984-8042 Vital Computer Systems, 5115 Beachcomber, Oxnard, CA  93035

  I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX2/66 to run Windows in 1280x1024.  I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro, and I'm pretty sure the 2M is really there because I *can* select 1024x768x65536.   But no matter what I do with the Flex program in the ATI's program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out. I have Windows 3.1, build 59 of the drivers, DOS 5.0.  The drivers were installed by Gateway, not by me, so perhaps there's a file missing from the hard drive.  It runs 1024x768 just fine.   I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024.  Sometimes it refuses (ghosted out), other time it accepts it, but when I hit OK and re-enter Desktop, it's back to 1024x768.  At no time does it unghost 1280x1024 in the main Flex window.

Hi netters, I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!  As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit: 	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item, 	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes 	 */ 	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152), 	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182), which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0. Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem? Any help is very much appreciated. Yuri
Hello world,   I'm attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an IBM PC for teaching purposes, so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings of the microcontroller as it performs operations - logical ands, for example, being shown on a bit-by-bit basis (1 AND 1 = 1) so that the students can see that it's not really a mystical process, but totally logical, for example. Every instruction should show some 'working', and not just alter register/memory/port contents.   Does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code, in Pascal or Modula-2, that would show me where I'm going wrong in writing my simulator? [I'm using Ayala's -The 8051 Microcontroller- as a reference - the simulator supplied with the package is overkill for simple teaching purposes, I feel, and there's no source code to help you roll your own.]   Please email me if you can help, or if you know of somewhere more  appropriate I should be posting this  - I rarely scan these groups.   Thanks,   Lloyd Wood

Hi all,   I have a IIsi with a floppy drive that might be bad (and might just be out of alignment, I haven't checked yet. :-))  If the drive is not easily reparable, I'd like to replace it with an _internal_ floptical.  Can this be easily done?  Can it be done at all?   I'm assuming that floptical drives can read and write both 800k and 1.4k floppies.  If this is not in fact true, please tell me. Thanks in advance,         ~ Kiran
>How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus? By initiating a DMA xfer.  :) Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower). ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or  crash.(I forget) Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit. The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1. I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA. In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers. I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either. I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel. Thanks.
I'm interested in getting an external hard drive for my SE/30.  I've got an internal 40MB that's pretty full, even with compression s/w.   Alot of people talk about $/MB, what's a good ratio?

I am using the GLX widget + athena widgets on a mixed-model application, under 4Dwm, but when the dialog gets popped up, its text entry field does not have focus. Aimilar code works perfectly if I use "pure X" (no mixed-model). HEre is the relevant portion of the code. {    int n;    Arg wargs[16];    Widget Button, PopUpShell, Dialog;    /* initialize TopLevel here */    .    .    .    n = 0;    XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNlabel, "Foo"); n++;    Button = XtCreateManagedWidget("FooBtn", commandWidgetClass,                                   TopLevel, wargs, n);    PopUpShell = XtCreatePopupShell("PupShell", overrideShellWidgetClass,                                    Button, NULL, 0);    XtAddCallback(PopUpShell, XtNcallback, MyPopUp, (XtPointer)PopUpShell);    n = 0;    XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNvalue, ""); n++;    Dialog = XtCreateManagedWidget("TheDialog", dialogWidgetClass,                                   PopUpShell, wargs, n);    .    .    . } void MyPopUp(w, popup_shell, call_data) Widget w; Widget popup_shell; XtPointer call_data; {    XtPopup(popup_shell, XtGrabExclusive); } --- A way I found to give focus to the text field is to move the application window around a little bit and place it right behind the popup. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Several others here  also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend  extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33  MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the  3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate  appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of  spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is  certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA  local bus.

There didn't seem to be one in the event mask lists I had on hand (although Button1MotionMask looked promising).  My references also mentioned using "|" to or two mask events.  Can you  use "&" to and two masks?  Would I want to in this case?  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks,  -lrm

A few posts back, somebody mentioned that the Duo might crash if it has the wrong kind (non-self refreshing) of RAM in it.  My Duo crashes sometimes after sleep, and I am wondering if there is any software which will tell me whether or not I have the right kind of RAM installed.  I had thought that the problem was the battery connection. Thanks in Advance, Archon Fung

Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for Windows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were: 1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an "ALWAYS ON TOP" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package. 2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take "snapshots"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful. 3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include "Backmenu", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in "backdesk.zip" is a program called "WRUN", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section. Try each of them out for yourself.  I was impressed with all of them, so find out which one suits your needs the best.

I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get 985 KB/s. I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my transfer rate went to 830 KB/s. The specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller transfer rate of 2.83 MB/s. I dont know how to get there from here. The local bus interface got me a little, but certainly not as much as I had hoped. I am also looking for a way to  improve my disk performance, but Im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck (although Im willing to entertain the possibility that it is). I am already running a big main memory disk cache, so Im not really interested in this solution either. --- Chris Brinton Teradyne, Inc. "My opinions are my own, but you're welcome to them."

I've seen from previous posts that many sites exist that store pictures - available through anonymous ftp. Except that I can't ftp to remote sites from my machine, what I CAN do is use 'ftpmail' - mail a list of commands to a server and receive a mail of files,  and/or data back. Does anyone know of sites, with Windows compatible pictures, that can be  accessed in such a way???  If you do would you please post them. TIA    Mark. PS.

I just got a copy of Tobias' Managing Your Money v9.0.  I have Quicken 6, and it's wonderful for some things, but MYM seems to have some features that Q6 doesn't.  For example, Q6 doesn't seem to be able to handle monthly automatic deductions from a checking account (you know, a monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from my checking account).  Or is there something that I'm not doing right, and Q6 can actually do that?  Anyway, MYM seems to be able to handle monthly deductions.  In fact, it can apparently do better than that. That is, you can specify monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, even yearly. Anyway, is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs? Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions?  Maybe someone who has used both.  Or maybe someone who is familiar with each could give me a capsule review?  Anything would be greatly appreciated.  If I keep MYM, I have to pay for it, and I don't know whether it's worth doing.  If MYM is better than Q6, of course I will keep it.  But if Q6 can do everything MYM can do (maybe even better), I won't.  Thanks all! If you post a reply, please also cc me.  Thanks.

We have recently obtained a copy of color_xterm (from export.lcs.mit.edu) after seeing it mentioned in a previous article. On compilation, it reports the following undefined symbols: 	_get_wmShellWidgetClass 	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass 	but still runs. When sending escape sequences to set the colour, any colour comes out as black text on a black background. Any Ideas? Has anyone used this program in colour successfully? Can anyone point me to any other colour terminal emulators? We are running OpenWindows 3 on Sun Sparcs running SunOS 4.1.3. 				advaTHANKSnce  Ben Kelley.
Hello world, I want to write my Xt-application code like this: {     do_some_work();     /* now I need some user input */     XmCreateDialog();     wait_for_user_input(input);     if (input == "OK") {        more_work();     } else {        other_work();     } } So "more_work() and other_work()" are not in callback functions but the application simply waits for the user to answer the question. How can I code this in my Xt/Motif-application? Thanks very much in advance. Greetings, Huub. --  1009 AB Amsterdam The Netherlands Tel. 31 20 5924080
Hello, We are having troubles using the PC/TCP onpredir (printer redirection program with lpr support) with the Windows print manager.

I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The X distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine.  BUT, also in the release notes, nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported, but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, but I'm *really* confused. --  "I will NOT raise taxes on the middle class." -Unknown
I recently purchased a Centris 610 and am having difficulty getting my computer to recognize my hard disk drive (external) Using both the disk uitily of TMS (Diskwriter) and Jasmine's software, neither one will show the drive.  The drive is the only device connected to the  scuzzi port. I cant find the manual to the tms pro 120 and seem to remember that it is "terminated".

I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently. Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, I guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for the current selection.  If I select a whole bunch of files, I will get an exact byte count. Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating! If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'. If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes',  not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only 893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say 3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!  It's as if it's got a problem with displaying more than 3 characters! My system: 486DX/33, 8M memory, Stacker 3.0, DOS 5, Win 3.1.  I've run the latest virus scanners (scan102, f-prot) and they didn't report anything.

I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written specs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup section says Apple 14" and 16" monitors can go on top, but 21" and other big ones can't.  Why couldn't they publish a maximum load? Now if I can figure out if there's any hope using the "partition" button on the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?), then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more securly.  The "getting more information" section of the manual suggested trying other avenues before calling Apple, but didn't mention the net. --  Mike Feldman, Motorola Computer Group,     (217) 384-8538, FAX (217) 384-8550 1101 East University Avenue	   Pager in IL (800) 302-7738, (217) 351-0009

And fill in the __'s below: No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed. Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs. And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the 68030. --  Ray Fischer                   "Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth

There are 3 alternatives: 1. You can try to write a small C program something like:    int my_int_var;    my_int_var = system("command");    and display my_int_var value (which is the exit code of the command). 2. Or use 4dos.com instead of command.com (it has built in move command)    you can also get any program exist code by using the exec function    of 4dos:    will display the exit code of the command. 3. Get DOS 6, not worth buying if you already have QEMM/PCTools/Norton,    and you only need the move utility. >the manual doesn't seem to have all of them.

If I were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one resource called "accelerators" that took a translation table, period. I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified one, it would be active and automatically installed. To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like: 	*menuItem.accelerators: #override \n\ 		Ctrl<Key>M:	fire() \n\ 		Shift<Key>L:	fire() \n The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a "Ctrl M" show up in your menuItem object.

I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and    made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most   evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of   experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA   resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.      My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It   worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the    guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed   a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.   So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer   one.    >--- >Sean Eckton >Computer Support Representative >College of Fine Arts and Communications >D-406 HFAC >Brigham Young University >Provo, UT  84602 >(801)378-3292 --  signoff ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Comprehensive Technologies Int'l Inc., Arlington, VA ==============================================================================

Word for Windows lets me designate text as being in a language other than US English.  (Alt-F L, Format | Language, as I recall.)

Email please; I'll post a summary. --  English is my native language and I love it.  But don't try to tell me that it's easy to learn or that it makes sense.

After reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadra or Centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, I decided to test the claim. I pulled out my Variable Speed Overdrive and the motherboard's 50 mhz clock chip. I put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a 64 mhz TTL clock oscillator I had left over from working on some SI's. I can't believe it. It actually works. I'm not getting SCSI timing errors either. This is only after a short run time but I'll keep posting results. Did I spend all that money on the VSO for nothing? If this keeps working, the lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort.

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position and the window at a position below it. This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current configuration and restore is later. Currently, my solution is: 	XCreateWindow(...); 	XSetWMProperties(..); 	XMapWindow(...); 	XFlush(...); 	XMoveWindow(...); It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering if I'm overlooking something obvious. Richard.
Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from Mac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed, and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in  thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering and fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one. My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general? Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is this a rarity? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience in this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of experience. That's about it. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary. Thanks all. --  "Is rot13 rotated 13 forward or backward?" 	--Anonymous

I am trying to write an image display program that uses the MIT shared memory extension.  The shared memory segment gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem. But the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage, with the following message: X Error of failed request:  BadShmSeg (invalid shared segment parameter)   Major opcode of failed request:  133 (MIT-SHM)   Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_ShmPutImage)   Segment id in failed request 0x0   Serial number of failed request:  741   Current serial number in output stream:  742 Like I said, I did error checking on all the calls to shmget and shmat that are necessary to create the shared memory segment, as well as checking XShmAttach.  There are no problems. If anybody has had the same problem or has used MIT-SHM without having the same problem, please let me know. By the way, I am running OpenWindows 3.0 on a Sun Sparc2. Thanks in advance-- John C.

Hi world,                  I want to buy a Spirit II 14400 Data/Fax modem (made in U.S.A.). Have anyone heard about it or using it? What is it's performance? Is it stable or not? Please give me some advice.           In addition, I heard a news from local distributor that a new 28800baud CCITT ROM (the distributor said it will be the new CCITT  standard.) for this modem will be produced at the end of this  year. After replaced the old ROM by this 28800 ROM, this Spirit II can transfer data at 28800baud without any hardware alternation. Is this  new true and possible? Would the telephone line really able to transfer  at such high speed? Please give me some advice.           At last, can anyone tell me how to contact with the central  dealer QuickComm. Inc.? (I am not sure whether it in U.S.A. or not.) Please leave me a e-mail.   Thank you very much.   Leung (from Hong Kong University)

VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30. IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K "window", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details. Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  "Fast SCSI-1" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast SCSI-1".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI. Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7" instead of the   old 12".  VLBus - "Architecture is identical to that of VLBus" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}. IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards. HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [ 60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.  BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one CPU in a computer"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez).  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development. OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.]  a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play. IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 ("Undocumented Windows") and  "There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of "Windows" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).  Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.  version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.  Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.} PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.  and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly. IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS. Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.

AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.} IBM   protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved. Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.

I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am running Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for my flatmates' games. My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE. Basically I have two choices 1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or 2) Get some sort of 486. Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high. The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25. I have a couple of questions. 1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point operations. 2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ? Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ? 	Any experiences will be most helpful ... 		Kenny. PS.

I agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these SONY tubes, however in the 17" monitors using these tubes, the 2 annoying black lines on the top and bottom quarters of the tube, which are created due to the wires holding up the Invar Shadow Mask, are quite annoying after a while.  That is the only thing that is making me lean more in favor of the NEC 5FG (or now also available the NEC 5FGe - only difference, no ACCUCOLOR ).

I have a lot of fonts that I can install either as Type-1 PostScript (under ATM) or as TrueType.  I have noticed that:     1.	TrueType font files are at least 1/3 larger than their Type-1 	equivalents.  If you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware 	that TrueType fonts will compress, whereas Type-1 fonts will not 	(they are encrypted).     2.	With a 300 dpi laser printer, the "artificial bold" version of a 	TrueType font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to 	install the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if I want 	to use them.  Type-1 PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually 	distinct bold variant from the base font.  I realize that the 	artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior 	to the hand-generated bold TrueType variant, but it is sufficient 	for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me 50% 	on disk space (uncompressed). -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories

However, just in case something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly". * MSDOS configuration:      The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions, you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive (this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system up. * Windows configuration:      To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the "[388Enh]" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry: 	VirtualHDIRQ=Off I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you might want to try adding some more lines: 	VirtualHDIRQ=Off 	SystemROMBreakPoint=false 	EMMExclude=A000-CFFF (You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The "SystemROMBreakPoint" entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs). * Windows 3.1 runs slowly:      Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's probably because:      1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your 	CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a 	winning solution.      2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to 	be seen .... If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808 ("SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS"), you must use Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other solutions.      Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1. What you can do is one of the following:      1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my 	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused 	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in 	Smartdrive.      2. Use a driver that provides "VDS" services ("VDS" stands for 	"Virtual DMA Services").  This is a standard, which is supported 	by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like 	the 1542) to work with Windows.      After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster: 1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI    functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two    physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your    CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.: 	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386    (Windows needs the "/V386" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into    LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies    about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be    obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's    still there). 2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version    3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers    in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.: 	DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS 	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386    Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high    (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would    crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support    about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine    as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.    On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would    occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting    Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my    C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes    usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE    the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason    SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.    I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of    ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.    Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without    SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider    these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems. 3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is    to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer    needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS    upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not    available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only    three ways to get a copy:       * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver 	kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other 	drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is 	around $75.       * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you 	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for 	around $30.       * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0 	for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in 	different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is 	included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two 	hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy 	of ASPI4DOS 3.1. Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers (this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem. ***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:      There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250: 1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive    constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. 2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.    (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.    However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so    I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my    1542.) * Tape backups/restores take a long time:      If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop, start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean). This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer than necessary.      The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops, rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it). The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is "too large".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec "hogs" the memory too much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops, because data is not fed to it quickly enough.      The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off. The "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can be done in one of two ways: * If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the "/n" option.  For example, I use   a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the   following line in my CONFIG.SYS file: 	DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4   Note that there is NO space between the "/n" and the "4". * If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a   program called "SETSCSI.EXE", which is very difficult to find.  The   reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to   want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for   Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have   anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to   hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have   it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so: 	setscsi -n:4   This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running   SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the   factory defaults.   Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use   ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I   could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however. Do not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4 microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may have to adjust it downwards a little.      Once you've lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores should run faster.      Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by starving memory refresh.      A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while), this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B, although the docs say that it works with the 1542A? * Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:      This "problem" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it. However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my 1542.      Symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the tape head: 1. Backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,    resulting in an aborted tape backup. 2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails. 3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.    Unlike the above-mentioned problem ("Tape backups/restores take a    long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,    this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so. 4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other    programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software    (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the    tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot. 5. Too many tape read errors.      Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250) reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive.      I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is; however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller. ***** Sound cards:      Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the tape DMA, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error (your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware.      I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo, recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).      Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the Adaptec's "bus on" timing.  See the section on tape drives for information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this. ***** Miscellaneous info:      This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm not sure.  Use it at your own risk. * With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "DB="   parameter (e.g., "DB=2"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.   If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM   manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that   a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM   command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install   program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of   QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a   version earlier than 6.00).   If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter. * Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one   gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you   need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is   still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec. * To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and   some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces   (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three   choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following   solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand   information):      1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for 	something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers, 	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact 	Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains 	everything that you need.      2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the 	same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM 	drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know 	the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around 	$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS 	driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS, 	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.      3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been 	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in 	case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the 	drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410 	kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of 	MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in 	the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin 	boards. * To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows   how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are   (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how   well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the   following is secondhand information):      1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large 	number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers 	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.      2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup 	program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more 	details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but 	requires, ASPI4DOS. * I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:      1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.      2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.      3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and 	CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.   I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:      4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI 	drivers). * Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar   for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you   need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used   this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know   how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,   a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites: 	PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL> 	ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx 	ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10 	ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr   I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might   have it, if any forum does. * As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are   the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.   However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and   there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work   with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of   BSD Unix). * In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file: 	FILES=40 	BUFFERS=40 	BREAK=ON 	STACKS=10,256 	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF 	DOS=HIGH,UMB 	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p   Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS   3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like: 	FILES=40 	BUFFERS=40 	BREAK=ON 	STACKS=10,256 	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF 	DOS=HIGH,UMB 	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386 	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p   If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked   like: 	FILES=40 	BUFFERS=40 	BREAK=ON 	STACKS=10,256 	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386 	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF 	DOS=HIGH,UMB 	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p   However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I   planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still   need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first   two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version   doesn't.  Local Variables: fill-column:	72 eval:		(auto-fill-mode nil) End:

Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very poorly written.

Dear Xperts, I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select an image file out of a directory. Now I would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name: XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL); and in the eventhandler do a:   while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))    ;   XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);   /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/ However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co    urse a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin    g wrong? Or is the a wrong approach to this problem? Any hints are highly appreciated. --- Phil

   Do you really need to switch to a DX2/66 instead of a DX50?  As I    understand it, DX50's can have local bus devices (on the mother-board?)    but not local bus slots.  And according to what I been told, many    systems go beyond the VESA local bus standard in order to provide DX50    systems with a local bus slot capability.  I have definitly seen a    mother board with 2 local bus slots which claimed to be able to    support any CPU, including the DX2/66 and DX50.  Can someone throw    some more informed light on this issue? You will need to check with peripheral makers to see if their boards will work at 50 MHz.  Some will with some motherboards. - Tony

I am using DOS Quick C 2.5 in a DOS window under Windows 3.1, and the other day while I was running the compiler, I got a general protection fault immediately followed by a "serious disk error".  When I rebooted, I found that about 15 files had gotten "cross-linked" which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system. I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem. I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained  by Windows.  If that is true, then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing  to do with it.

If you're still on 3.0, 3.1 devotes about twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently. If 3.1, you might use one of the resource monitors (such as the one that comes with the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available) to see which programs are hogging the resources (every icon, internal graphics brush, etc. in every program running uses a certain amount of this limited memory area. Also, some don't give it back when they're finished). Lamont Downs

To those interested in the new ATI Ultra Cards: I had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions. This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that replied. > 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM. a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB    and EISA version should have no problems.   b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't    work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way    of switching the "memory aperture" feature off to prevent this,    but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some "help me" messages    on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this    problem. c) FALSE d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M    by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.    The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards. > 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches >    set but it is much slower. a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM    (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you.    b) Dunno. c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus > 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes. a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all    non-interlaced. b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version    that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced. c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.    Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to     do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color    and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding. > 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many >    cases. a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which    I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due    to software incompatibility. b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54. c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain    graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they    do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..    other accelerated cards also have bugs. d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my    NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.    I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond    Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver. > 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money. a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.   b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what    I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)    every 20 minutes or so... c) Depends on many many things. > 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-) a) I like it. b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is. c) Yes, this appears to be true :-) d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are    coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.    Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was     developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)    Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this group so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar with the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don't have an Graphics Ultra yet.) ATI Graphics Ultra Plus: - Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours - True colour(16.7M) at 800x600 - Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)   Stretch full motion video windows to full size - Fast VGA - Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only) - Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think) - Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop - Around a 1/2 length card size - Priced from $400 U.S. ATI Graphics Ultra Pro: - Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus - Faster performance with VRAMS - Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced - Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel - Priced from $600 U.S. ATI Technologies (416) 756-0718 I hope this summary can be of use to you. Al P.S.  I am not associated with ATI Technologies in any way other       than having used their previous ATI Ultra card for a few       years (which I generally liked). --

Howdy, Sorry if this has been covered before: One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said "No problem" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition  was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried  to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am  unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I  kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS  installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for  "Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC")... Thanks in advance, Paul "Mr. SCSI... NOT!" Fincke

The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read on... I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget, displays the widget for a while, then destroys everything and returns.  The problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things): - Core Dump - BadPixmap X Error - Widget not unmapped Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem: #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> void bla() {         XtAppContext app;         Display *dis = XOpenDisplay("");         int junk = 0;         Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0);         Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         top,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);         XtRealizeWidget(top);         //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents         for (int i=0;i<=10;i++)         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(app, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         } // WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???         XtUnrealizeWidget(top);         XtDestroyWidget(top);         XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);         XCloseDisplay(dis); // ??? } main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)                 bla(); } Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example, after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program. With this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent) the 5th call to bla(): X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)   Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)   Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d   Serial number of failed request:  71   Current serial number in output stream:  86 If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the seconds call. Furthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I get: So finally, my question is this: What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times? Any help would be greatly appreciated. PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group. Thanks very much. -davewood --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Another thing, why a SCSI interface ? Because SCSI works well with removable media, and works well with large capacity devices. The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge it. Plus, it's extremely low performance. AND, SCSI has gobs of room for expansion compared with a floppy (I can just see it, let's stick a 5.25", a 3.5", a tape drive, and a MO drive, all on the floppy interface.

Hello Motif World, a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++. My question is: How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or changed. If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. --  Ronald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference  3DCV Group, Utrecht |    The Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.
Hi! I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5" drive  (normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable  from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25. The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from those drives. I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on. I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I  try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there is no disk in the drive. Can anyone offer any suggestions? I'm in desperate need of help!!! Thank you for your time. Eric Balog

>|> I need to get an Apple 40SC tape backup unit working under >|> Sys 7.0.x, but do not have any drivers/software to access the device.  >Retrospect (Dantz) works nicely with this combination. I also use Retrospect, but I noticed that Central Point Software's "MacTools Backup" also supports the Apple tape drive under 7.x.  The Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than  might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive.   Used Apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less economic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for Retrospect when MacTools  is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities. Retrospect is nice, though, and I'm probably going to upgrade to 2.0. --  -- 38 Chambers Street; Newark, DE 19711; (302)368-1949

I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA monitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III.  All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!

I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and have run into a problem.  I imagine it has something to do with a missing screen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there in Internet land might be able to help. I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my /usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI, so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message along the lines of: Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket sunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for device Fatal server error : no screens found  Any ideas on how I can fix it?

I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25" mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't figure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the bottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas? Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for. Third, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to work and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was troublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on the MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back on agian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many cases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit convertor is more then sufficient. AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases you are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled also. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly distorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the occurrence of the spike that is important.  However, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start battling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue were to start looking for the technical specifications. Peter.

I am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a remote display.  A local display being connected to the same system that the client is executing on.  I have access to the display string but can I tell from the string? If the client is executing on host foo then ":0", "unix:0", "foo:0", and "localhost:0" are all local.  Under Ultrix, I believe that "local:0" is also a valid display name (a shared memory connection maybe?).  Are there other strings that I should check for?  Is there a better way to detect this?

Sorry about the misinformation.  I made a bad assumption about the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900, see previous post.  About sampling the CD audio though, have you tried it?  I  found the aliasing to be really bad.  Like it needed a filter or something. Much worse than I expected.  I installed the CD-300 in the  Quadra myself so maybe I missed something.  Everything else works great though.

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think it's great! However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why? Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU). How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2? Thanks for any comments. Randy

Would someone please email me the pinout for a PS/2 6-pin mini DIN mouse port?  I'm trying to make an adapter for a serial mouse, and the dealer who knows what adapter works with the mouse I bought doesn't have it in stock. I have several different adapters, but none of them make sense based on what sketchy information I have about the port (they have connections to "reserved" pins). -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories

The problem is with ISA bus-masters which can only address the first 16MBs of system memory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU nor the system DMA to do the actual data transfer but transfer their data directly to the system RAM. rp93 -- 

I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, but my spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario: 	1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller 	2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy) 	3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy) 	4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days  		(getting happier) 	5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again) 	6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days 			(cooling off, the end is in sight) 	7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad 		(VERY unhappy) Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days) 	and have on-site service install it for me. BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole  thing is going back.     I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer. I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again. Oh well, I feel better now... --  -----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____----- | Mark Devaney                     - Hear me now and believe me later     | | Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Georgia, 30332		  |

Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.

The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the  Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)   The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it. Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics  highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move  the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve  screen space, it stays an icon. The desired behavior: one of two options -      1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the         inactive one.     2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon        but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher         level than the Xterm. What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term. These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the  command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term. Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb  X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif. Thanks for your time.

[Please accept the following announcement for comp.windows.x.announce. -gf] A completely revamped version of the X11 browser interface to Archie, Xarchie, is now available as 	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xarchie-2.0.tar.Z For those not familar with Archie or Xarchie, I include part of the manpage intro:   Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the Archie Internet information   system using the Prospero virtual filesystem protocol.  Archie   provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the   Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,   point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp   sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows   you to retrieve files located this way. Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the new features (from the README) follows:   * Major improvements include:     - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new       features (FWF MultiList widget).     - Ability to expand directories in browser.     - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.     - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.     - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable       pseudo-weights.     - Online help browser.     - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.     - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.     - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

>SCSI-I ranges from 0-5MB/s. >SCSI-II ranges from 0-40MB/s. >IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                                        >ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions) The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI: SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer  base. SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides  SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}. The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put} From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for "20% faster then IDE" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2  contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip. The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the "20% faster then IDE" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes. When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }
I'm looking for a complete hw/sw solution: I need an ISA/VLB scsi controller (e.g Ultrastor 34F) plus a tape drive (500Mb or less like Archive) plus a Windows program that will work on these.

So does anybody have a tape backup setup like what I'm looking for ? Please describe it. Thanks. e-mail please. --

I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave, as I have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE ( And custom Controller Mdl CI-1010 Extended IDE Controller ) While maintaining my RLL'd Wren as master Drive.  The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Drives while coexisting with existing Controllers ( MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI ). So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI, and I can assure you it works with RLL.

Subject: (Q) COMPAQ configuration. HELP!! Hi All COMPAQ owners A friend of mine has COMPAQ (PORTABLE III), and he has lost all the manuals and diskettes. Please HELP him getting the machine's equipment definition (CMOS) memory configuration right. The machine says that some bytes of it are still  incorrectly set up. It seems, that COMPAQ has some bytes defined not like the 100% IBM compatible machines. If You have a COMPAQ, it certainly has DIAGNOSTICs diskette with it. And this is needed. I can't reach quickly any COMPAQ dealers here. If it is possible PLEASE email documentation, or some of its configuration software.

Dear Mac-friends, I've seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines all with 17 Mb RAM installed (70 or 80 ns SIMMs). If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated on the screen.  The lines translate to the top of the screen and have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they are a few millimeters apart). I admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly, especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark. Applications which produce this effect are: - the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2) - Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU The machines use their built-in video and drive the old  Apple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).   The effect is independent of the settings in the following control  panels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache)          and Monitors (nr of greys/colors). Have you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ? Thanks, Fred ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research | FAX:      31-30-543163

Hello.      I purchased a video card called ET-4000 true color card which      can provide about 1700K colors. But the question is I can't find      the corresponding drivers for windows 3.1 , I am now using 65k      colors driver for win31. It works fine , but I think it will be      better if I use 1700k driver. So, please tell me whether such a      driver is available !      Thanks in advance. --  ===================== ( Forever  23,  Michael Jordan.) =====================

There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs (unlike DRAM SIMMs which  come in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with  differing amounts of VRAM on them.

Is there a Wyse 60 Terminal Emulator or a comms toolbox kit available on the net somewhere? Thanks. Vince
You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows than in DOS - regardless of what communication software you are using. Try the following:    1) Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The        cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine        it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.    2) Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UART's (8250 or 16450)        can only buffer one character internally.  The new UART's (16550) can        buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.  You can run        \windows\msd.exe to find out what UART is on the machine. Ron

Does anyone have an idea of where to get these drivers? Address for an ftp-site would be nice.

A couple of questions for the multimedia set: 1.  Does anybody have a phone or fax number, or e-mail address, or name of a principal in CEDAR Technologies in Dublin, New Hampshire? All I have is a post-office box number, and I want to ask a couple of questions before sending them some money.  Any info much appreciated. 2.  I'm running an SE/30, which came with no microphone. Is there any way, other than using MacRecorder with SoundEdit or CEDAR's digitizer with some similar software, to input recorded sound into my Mac? I'm trying to play some very short interview clips in a HyperCard stack. Thanks for any and all help. Kathy McTaggart

I must say that the connections between the power supply and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the last phase (lower Voltage). So you can do following if you are used to such technical terms. 1) Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray 2) readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply 3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowin through the floppy!

              at Oracle Corporation.  The opinions expressed are those               of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle. Hello, 	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have   8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.   both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid... So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly   appreciated. -Eric

In the May issue of C't Magazine was an article about upgrading 040 models of apple.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence "ESC [ 1 B 7"  would indicate that the "HOME" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as "shift-Return". If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file "x11term.c".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it. Notes:   * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.  * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are    in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could     easily be adapted for anything else. +-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+ +-------------------------------------------------------+---- \XX/ -------+

This probably tells you something >> about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME >> of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have  >> to say? I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect English constructs such as "its raining" or "it's window id" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!). On a related topic, who is to say that "color" is more or less correct than "colour" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as "XAllocColor" and "colormap". In a world that uses the term "Windows" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept "X Windows" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, "the X Window System" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title ("X" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called "Microsoft Windows" or "the Microsoft Window System" or how about just plain "Microsoft"! To summarise (or should that be "summarize") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be "windowing system"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. 			Du Pont Pixel Systems Ltd.

Hi,   I am working on gathering data on the way that users use computers. This involves getting subjects to type and use a  mouse. I want to be able to watch what they are doing without  being in the same room. It would be ideal if I could watch the session on another monitor without the subjects knowledge. I believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for short distances, ie <5m. I will need to be approx 10m away, as the cable travels.   The PC's are connected to a TCP\IP network and run Windows 3.1. Is there any software that will allow me to watch what is  happening on another PC? Thanks Regards   Jon Gough TRUST Project
>I am trying to figure out the current C++ toolkit "directions". >More simply, I'd like to know which C++ toolkit to "bet on"  >for use in a new long term project. I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++, and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance, but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted, and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task. At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve. - Brad --  Brad Daniels		`	|  "If money can't buy happiness, I don't work for NeoSoft, and	|		- Weird Al Yenkovic don't speak for my employer.	|
Hello all, You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-) This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any. serials/paral/floppies and  	- IDE controller "clone" Gw2760-EX 		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-(  	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt). 	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages 		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt) 	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies. 		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170, 		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff) simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be  a nice bonus but is not expected. Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable. I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone, or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE,  depending on setup/jumpers. Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - --- " --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not  rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change a chip or put a jumper! Also useful: - BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital. - ftp archives with relevant info. - expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while) - any hints into inner workings of the system ...  - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) ) Direct or posted replies are ok.

[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated] >8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec. If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from? SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point. SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.} SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s} SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst. SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY   As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the  controler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}
Subject: ** Need Advice ** (about Tech Works etc.) Greetings!! 	I planning to upgrade my Mac IIsi: 		(1) from the present 5Megs to 17Megs; 	and	(2) add a Math-Coprocessor. 	Technology Works, of Austin (Texas) comes quite highly recommended by  some Mac magazines.  I was just wonderring if anyone could share with me  anything about Tech Works (both good and bad experiences); or give any advice about other mail-order companies that I may consider. 	Your reply would be very much appreciated.  Thanks in advance. Sincerely Peter Choo

Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff. To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance.

>I posted this a while ago and didn't receive one reply, and now we >have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out? The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: "Ctrl Any<Key>q". >In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says "For information >on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...", this is so you >know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to >Vol. 4 it says, "Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is >nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For >example, the translation: >	Shift<Key>q:	quit() >will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as >the Shift key (and the q key). This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations. >Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? If you mean "menu accelerator", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page. >Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you >can't use XtInstallAccelerators(). I can't think of a reason why not. >How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of >case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one >menu entry. There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell). For example,   applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade 					  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton 							  - exitPushbutton   *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q   *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate) You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments. I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.

The 1992.1 disk has both sources and binaries and it sells for $50.  I've tagged a table of contents and an orderform on below if anyone's interested. Alex Newman ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alex Newman	(617) 232-0514 voice	My life may be stressful, Sun User Group * 1330 Beacon St., #315 * Brookline, MA 02146 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  SUG CD 1992.1 is X11R5 and GNU on a CDROM, priced at $50 to SUG members, including a caddy! SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries, almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings, priced at only $250. Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks. The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside. The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a total of 543MB of material, including: X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

Does anyone know how to reach Micron?  I am interested in getting some specifics about what types of monitors work with their Micron Xceed card for the se/30.  either e-mail or phone number would be prefered. Or if you have the answers to my questions, i'd appreciate a reply. Thanks. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------- julia hsieh              My opinions are not intended to reflect ----------------------------------------------------------------
I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17" Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results. In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA, Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3 cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported. The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well. The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either. The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit. K means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second              Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000 Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000 DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K Memory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M Screen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M Vector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M Vector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K Polygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M Polygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M Ternary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K Font                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me.... I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers, but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company. geoff sherwood

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one menu entry. In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says "For information on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...", this is so you know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to Vol. 4 it says, "Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For example, the translation: 	Shift<Key>q:	quit() will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as the Shift key (and the q key). This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do what I want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user presses the control key, the shift key, and the o key. Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use XtInstallAccelerators(). I am using Motif 1.1.3 on a DECstation 5000 but I have also tried it on an HP using Motif 1.1.3 and 1.2. --  ********************************************************************** Software Engineer         Applicon Inc.

I like it a lot. It is worth the additional expense. The only problem I found is with MS Word (5.1a). If you have a table the is longer than a page and the cells have a visible border, the last (bottom of page) line on the first page will be missing. It makes no difference how the table is formatted. The worst is that it doesn't show up in word's page view or page preview.  -- Arie. ========================================================================= | Arie Covrigaru                 |  University of Michigan AI Lab       | | Phone: (313)994-8887           |  Room 149, Advanced Technology Bldg. | =========================================================================
Hi to all you PC gurus! I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently asked, but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems with my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find corrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware item? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly aligned etc? As might be expected, I would greatly appreciate any help on this matter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything (and hoping that will fix the problem), but I would like to have some assurance of what the problem cause is.  Also, can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression and defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)?  Much thanks in advance for any help. Mitchel Soltys
   Environment:       mach/arch : sparc/sun4  (IPX)       OS	: SunOS 4.1.3       X11	: X11R5 (patchlevel 22)       Motif	: 1.2.2 I bring up X server using 'startx' and /usr/bin/X11/Xsun. The following sequence of actions crashes the X server (SIGPIPE, errno=32, 'xinit' reports that connexion  to X server lost):    1. xinit -- Xsun    2. start mwm    3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.    4. move the window by dragging the title bar. The server dumps core due to SIGPIPE. One of the two messages is printed:   "Connection to X server lost" or      "Connection broken (errno=32)" (I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself). Next, I ran xdm in debug level = 5. After the same set of actions, xdm reports:   select returns -1   Server for :0 terminated unexpectedly: status 2560 Note:  * The problem doesn't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm).   * I have not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.   * I am not running font server.   * If I start the client with fixed width font, I do not see this problem.  * My font path:      /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi    (I did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi,    /usr/lib/X11/fonts/PEX, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,    and in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc).  * This problem seems to occur only on IPX machines.

First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,   including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more   shared memory segment.   Terrible, but it works. 				Regards, 					Richard Gooch....
Hello all, If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and motherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know.  I have tried some mail order places and some local stores.  Both groups would prefer that I part with over $1000 to get just the case.  In my eyes this seems about $600-$700 to much.  Any comments?  I currently own the guts of a 950. Please email me or post to this group w/ info, Thanks in advance, Andy

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.) 	I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced. 	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS). --  \---------------------------------------------------------------------/  \ Seth Buffington 	U.S.S.

I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system: 486-33 DX, 16 mb of ram on a Novell 3.11 network Major considerations: I expect I will work mostly in windows, but with some DOS applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics. With a 15" monitor, I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256 colors seems plenty, but I'd like like the image to be sharp, fast, and rock solid. Other considerations: I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party development of drivers. I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking. I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and upgrading to local bus later). I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well. If you have any advice for me, I'd love to hear it via email or post. Thanks. |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ David M.

Greetings,         Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info,  please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension), and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.         The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big case. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far: 1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case? 2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work? 3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station?  I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in? What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost? Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC-  quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too. Any input is welcome. Thank you. Peter Liu

Try another vendor, I wish I had. While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM, it is only "relatively" recent that the Windows drivers for this card have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing, mis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01. If there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their BBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother notifying me of fixes/releases. Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the "right" person in curing some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not confirmed the validity of that statement. When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than Diamond.

This will allow you to connect your Localtalk network (4 Macs) to your Ethernet network (NeXT and Ethernet Mac).  It will route TCP/IP protocol between the two networks.  Software routers are also available for less money, but I'm not sure if they work with TCP/IP. Paul
I read an article about the benefits of a VLB motherboard. It said that a  true VLB board supports bus mastering, otherwise it is just as good as an ISA motherboard. Doesn't all VLB motherboard support bus mastering? I just bought a 486-33 VLB and the tech manual does not explicitly state the words "local bus mastering" but it said it "supports bus master and slave modes". Are these terms synonymous? Thanks. PS. - please reply by e-mail as I don't read this newgroup often.

About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver. So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number? Any assistance appreciated. Regards BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with      the rest with the 641. --  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  Nigel Harwood  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <<   FAX: +61 3 829 6886                                           >>

This may be a simple question but: We have a number of PC's which we use to link to a mainframe using  Novell LAN WorkPlace for DOS (via WIndows 3.1).  Now, to make life easier for us we are thinking of using Windows for Workgroups to allow file sharing across our PC network.  Now does anyone know if it is possible to use W4WG and Lan Workplace for DOS at the same time.  ie Can I access a file on another PC while being logged on to the mainframe at the same time, simultaneously.

Hello all. 	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me. 	I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read an old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw- back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the Micron Xceed) ? 	Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?) but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions? Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize. I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order companys that sell monitors or cards. Thanks in advance Eggert Thorlacius University of Iceland

I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + Future Domain TMC-1660 + Seagate ST-21M MFM controller.  The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system, and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices). The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM hard disks can't be found. The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 & Seagate MFM controller) are in the system.  Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg is connected. I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/O port. Have I missed anything? I am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed. Thanks in advance.

I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4"). Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters. What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment?  Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? --  ............................................................... :      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             : : Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park, NC : ...............................................................

The following problem is really bugging me, and I would appreciate any help. I create two windows: w1 (child to root) with event_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask; w2 (child to w1) with do_not_propagate_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask; Keypress events in w2 are discarded, but ButtonPress events fall through to w1, with subwindow set to w2.

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I came up with: ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm. Quick summary of each commmand: Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0. L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet) N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet) X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual) &D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always on S11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle) In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right before the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer  function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra 14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string. In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changed the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, and everything seems to work fine. Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forward this to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save other newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, and also save the net some redundant messages.  If anyone else has something to add, feel free. Marcus --  ///  Marcus Lobbia            ///

These   are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the   performance of your workstation.   Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more   hardware is always even a necessity.   This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different   people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X   Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.   Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must   balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal   decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.   This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.   However, they are outside the scope of this document.     [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook     "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the     way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written     comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any     other similar books.  --ed.] ----------------- Table of Contents -----------------   0. Introduction & Administrivia   1. What about the "Other X FAQ"?   2.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few   months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably   locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.   If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does   not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can   retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.   There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about   them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the   news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.

If   you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by   command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body. ----------------------------- What about the "Other X FAQ"? -----------------------------   well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.   The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: 	"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers ---------------   There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.    A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".   Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:   -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is   the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)   and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the   display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - -   Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.   If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.   On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between   the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to   me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging.     How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and   does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help   performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few   pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone   who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.   Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - -     If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep     for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my     .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...     we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.   This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!     why this works, which I have summarized here:     When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.     Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation's limited resources   This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.   Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &   I've experimented with: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &   I've even tried: 	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &     [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]   All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.   One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.   eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since   I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -     Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves   One suggestion:     In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: 	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N     [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]     So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.     This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). 	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]   This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:     - Easier to maintain / more usable.     - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.     - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.   It also has drawbacks:     - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application's resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to "xrdb" again.     - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!       I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.       The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.     - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.     - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find   A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for   clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.   See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.   "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn't set specially."   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.   I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if   you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.] ------- Clients -------   If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?   Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.   [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]   I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.   The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.   Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment. A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo    available: on export.lcs.mit.edu    Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.

I've heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any    yet.    UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.    As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.    So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.

Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - -   Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.   Text Field Widgets:     I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].   This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.   - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)   - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm     conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.     I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.   - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway. 			for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.     e.g. (for twm) :       menu "mouse settings" {         "Mouse Settings:"			f.title 	"  Very Fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &" 	"  Normal (Fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &" 	"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"	! "xset m default &" 	"  Glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &"       } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -     To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:     - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.     - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.     - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)     - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.     - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)   [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]   - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.     Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.   - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.     This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     same operation between client and server.   I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.     The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------   Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.     A lot more tips on performance are in the paper "Improving X     Application Performance" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in     Issue 3 of The X Resource.

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code to update the date after midnight never gets called.  Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources) or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock). Mark Aitchison, University of Canterbury.

It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick. I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.  I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features. For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy. Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up, down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know much beyond that. --       Will Christie       |    AATCHOO!      | PHILOSOPHY: the principles and   University of Manitoba  |    Uh-oh...      |  science of thought and reality   Winnipeg, MB, Canada   |   I'm leaking    | PHILOSOPHER: someone who thinks
Can anyone tell me what the difference is between a 256K DRAM chip and a 256K SIMM? I need the former (I think) to add memory to my Laserwriter LS. Someone is offering to sell me 256K SIMMS he removed from an SE, but I have a feeling this may not be the correct form of memory. The sockets in the Laserwriter look like they want the spidery-shaped chips (there are 4 sockets, each with, as I recall, 20 pins, arranged in two rows of 10). Believe it or not, I've never actually seen a SIMM. Help appreciated. --   =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=
To clarify:   VC++ *is* considered an upgrade for C7.  There will be no product called C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists its version as 8.00).  C7 is not a "DOS"-only product -- it is a C/C++ compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is VC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initial impressions have been very favorable. Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7. If you haven't, call Microsoft and I'm sure they'd be happy to send you some! -Jefrem Iwaniw Pelican Software Corporation
Hi folks, 	what exactly is the maximum memory I can put in a Quadra 700. My manual says 20MB (with 4 x 4MB SIMMs),  but MacWarehouse and the like advertise 16MB SIMMs to give it a total of 68MB. Who's wrong? Has anybody got 68MB? Thanks, 	Chris __________________________________________________________________________
G'Day Windows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system: 	Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize 	binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have 	bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc... 	Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac  	and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which  	has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in  	80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. 	Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems. 	Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton  	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform  	or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. 	so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on   	my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential. 	Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS 	or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files. 	Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have 	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch 	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly. In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it. Anyone know of something like this ? 	adios 	     Ata <(|)>. --  | Mail          Dr Ata Etemadi, Blackett Laboratory,                          | |               Space and Atmospheric Physics Group,                          | |               Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine,        | | Span                              SPVA::atae       or     MSSLC:atae        |

I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's get value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am not using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya). Anyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think) call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).   In other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself. Any ideas anyone?   --  /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ Ride Fast, Take Chances!
I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning. In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM. The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:     +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+ to this:                    +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  =============== Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this into the next "official" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm, and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of? One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-) In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:         +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+  =================== The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long. The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c: #ifdef SHAPE 	case F_SQUEEZELEFT: 	{	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 }; 		if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor)) 		  return TRUE; 		tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze; 		SetFrameShape( tmp_win ); 		break; 	} 	.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and 	squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { "f.squeezeleft", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file: Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter  ================= About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out. Since then, "blast" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19, Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. Better to have a twm-style window manager, I think. -- Ralph Betza (FM), "The question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting  than the question of whether a submarine can think" - Lenny Dykstra

Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools (v7.1) compress?  I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than PC-Cache running, so that is not it.  The first time I try to run Ami Pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (I think it was a)  segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes, with all times after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module AMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147.  I have not been able to fix this problem except by reinstalling Ami Pro.  This has happened twice, with both times being after having ran compress on my hard drive.  BTW, I am not running stacker or any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know, PCTools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name.  My system is a 386-40MHz, with 16MB of RAM and a NEC (OEM) hard drive, etc, but that shouldn't make a difference. PLEASE email me as I can't keep up with the newsgroup, and it will cut down on net traffic anyways.  Thanks. 				-Derek
Organization: /etc/organization 	Just wanted to ask a question. I bought a hard disk drive second-hand the other day, and I opened the packaging up and saw that there was a small sticker on the drive that had a little red apple with a bite taken out of it. It's socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my computer already (it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of the 39 that is sticking out of my old hard disk. I don't know if disk drives for the Apple (or Mac) are different from ones used in AT clones, so could someone tell me if I could use this hard disk on my AT clone? If not, what did I just purchase? It's a Quantum Prodrive. It's dated 1988 on the green board. Will I need a controller/add-in card? All the help is much appreciated. Thanks! :) PC

I am using a 8507 IBM monitor (19" greysale) with a Trident (1MB) card. The screen looks great (Windows) at 640x480 but total shit at 1024x768. There are lots of lines and the image is sorta blurry.

All of these have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS. Lumping them all together as 'SCSI' is dumb and sloppy.  Take again the quote later on as an example of the problem  in the PC world {The spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were coming from in the article.

YOU keep deleting them! So here are the Specs on everybody AGAIN {With some added info}: SCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s  synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is  mainly in software not hardware. SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with  10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the  PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.} {I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst >IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                            asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}  synchronous range: 0-8.3MB/s. >ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions) >Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this >debate.

With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.} Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:  (My comments in {}) "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..." {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with  a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use NOT because the interface itself is a mess. SCSI means "The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2" NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it. To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} "Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE..." or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} "Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE..." NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity. If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking  about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}.  Lumping everything into SCSI as SCSI-1 is SLOPPY, WRONG, and DUMB.  Inconsitant SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 usage is also a problem.  Clean it up now or have a mess like SVGA was several years ago because everybody and his Uncle slapped 'SCSA' an their own monitor inteface {SCSI IS standarized unlike SVGA was years ago EXCEPT in terminaology.}
I am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics and imagery.  The user of the widget will be able to specify, when creating it, whether it is to operate in X or GL mode. I have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button presses.  They work fine when the widget is in X mode.  In GL  mode they only work when the widget (my GL/X widget) is a child of a manager.  Put another way, the translations do not work  when the widget is configured in GL mode and is a child of a  shell.  Does anyone know why this is happening? Thanks in advance. Bruce Gendler
I've been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection Faults on a 486-33, Eisa-VLB, system.  At this point I think I've narrowed the problem down to the video drivers for the Volante Warp-10 adapter by National Design, INc. Yet somehow I find this hard to believe.  Does anyone else have any experiences with this board. Thanx, Robert Moskal Brooklyn, USA
Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget.   Unfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the various X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of frequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and things of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself? Any and all help would be very appreciated. Many thanks,     ---Mark ===============================================================================

I'm using int15h to read my joystick, and it is hideously slow.  Something like 90% of my CPU time is being spent reading the joystick, and this is in a program that does nothing but printf() and JoyRead(). The problem is that a lot of programs trap int15h ( like SMARTDRV ) and so it is a slow as hell interface.  Can I read the joystick port in a reasonably safe fashion via polling?  And that isn't platform or clockspeed specific? Thanks, Brianzex

> Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they > get with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate > that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!!  Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache. It's small enough that I will attach it. I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU. The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it. If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called "Performance Rating" numbers by themselves are of no interest.  Cheers.

The problem is this: After starting up my machine it gives a high pitched sound once at the desktop also it only does it when the mouse is up or a menu is not showing. as if I click the mouse the noise goes away for the amount of time the mouse is down. also this problem only happens for about 5-10 minutes. please let me know if you know what this is, it sounds like it is coming form the power supply.

This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The proposed groups are described below: NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about 	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT. NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:	 Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT, 	 including issues such as security, networking features, console 	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability. RATIONALE: 	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family 	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish 	to argue about the meaning of an "OS").  The family ranges from 	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to 	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over 	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the 	actual release is slated for May/June '93. 	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares 	an application programming interface with the other members of the 	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win- 	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking 	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for 	Windows 3.1. 	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows 	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses 	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre- 	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced 	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and 	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications. 	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following 	groups with the other members of the Windows family: 		comp.os.ms-windows.apps 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32 	 	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as 	well as Windows 3.1: 		comp.os.ms-windows.announce 		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy 	 	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the 	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal 	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating 	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have 	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate 	newsgroup hierarchies. 	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 -- 	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next- 	generation Windows, "Chicago", debuts next year, surely it should 	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus- 	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions? DISCUSSION PERIOD: 	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.

I have a small Windows program which I can not get to work;  The program looks vaguely like this: ============================================= char f1[80]; int WinMain(... {   lstrcpy ((LPSTR)f1, "Hello");   ... } long far pascal WndProc(... {   lstrcpy ((LPSTR)f1, "Hello");   ... } =============================================  I am using large model under Windows 3.1; after linking without errors, the RC program said Sorting preload segments and resources into fast-load section Copying segment 1 (53679 bytes) RC : fatal error RW1031: Segment 1 and its      relocation information is too large for load      optimization. Make the segment LOADONCALL or      rerun RC using the -K switch if the segment must      be preloaded. Using the -K switch seems to interfere with the proper function of the second lstrcpy call... can anybody explain what is going on and/or how to fix it? Thanks...
        I am having something very unusual happen.  First  some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in  about every 100 files are affected.             I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s  system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about  smartdrv to help me out. --                     UUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver NetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115
With a sound card on interrupt 5, two serial ports (one for modem on i4, one for Miracle Piano on i3) and a printer port on i7, I have run out of low interrupts.  What I would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of 10, 11, or 12 (which ever interrupt the PS/2 mouse port uses) in in ISA i486 computer.  I called technical support of Microsoft, Logitech, & ATI (checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ATI video cards can use) and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones lower than 7.  Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts? Loran Yourk             (708)979-9378
We have a Gateway 486DX50 with a SMC Elite16 Series Ethercard Plus. When we use NCSA FTP to send from the Gateway with hash turned on, we see 4 hash marks immediately.  Then the computer  r e a l l y  drags.  If we turn  off the internal cache of the 486, the speed is better, but doesn't match the speed when we receive to the Gateway. It doesn't matter if we send from the Gateway or get to it: 4 hash marks and  then extreme slowness if the cache is not disabled. Does anyone know any more about this?  Is there a fix? The Gateway was purchased in June, 1992. Please respond directly.  You wouldn't believe how slow the news is on this  system.    Thanks. 
Well, my 14inch VGA 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just bit the bullet. I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years. How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck??? *really* good one and get by with a cheap EGA monitor for now? I rather save my money to upgrade my 386SX to 486-66 though... Thanks! --  =============================================================================== What engineers say:     Extensive effort is being applied on a fresh approach to the problem.

Excuse me to every one. I am an Amiga owner and tired to have the same graphic modes. So I saw on nn there was a little bridgeboard that made the Amiga's PC slots communicate with the stanndard Amiga's slot. The building mother house of this little gadget assure me that using this thing I can use all the pc boards included the SVGA cards. I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many things about pc in general. So, what is the best (ISA slot) card on the market ? I'd like to reach resolutions like 1280x1024 with 256 colors or 800x600 with 24 bitplanes. Any suggestion ?? thankyou in advance Paolo Silvera -- Certified Commodore Amiga developer
Some kind soul told me that I could change the serial port buffer size of Zterm via ResEdit. He did not tell me HOW I could change it using ResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address. Could he or any one else please tell me what to do? I assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, and I have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correct resource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play around a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port. (other than Appletalk). BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is 3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are using hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo, and can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond 3074 (out of 4096) bytes. Makes sense to me. Scott Petrack

Hi folks, At the end of the summer I'm planning on getting a new computer (486DX50 or 486DX2/66) and have been poking around in Computer Shopper.  Anyway I saw the ads for the Diamond Viper (Local Bus, 2MB memory, 50 million+ WinMarks) and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it (good/bad/not worth the money/etc.)  Any information at all would be nice. Also, a few other questions.  Anyone know of a good cheap 15"+ 1024x768 NI monitor?  And what is a good CD-ROM drive that meets MPC standards and is controlled via SCSI?  How about a 250MB tape drive on SCSI? Thanks for your time, Brent Casavant

>I remember someone mention about a 150meg syquest.  Has anyone else >heard anything about this?  I'd be interested in the cost per megabyte and the >approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150. I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe). It is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the  drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the  differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production. I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold  105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives. Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to  getting my hands on one. -Chris Wand --  "Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."                                                      - Frank Leahy

I know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all >C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80 configuration.  Why would they >be so unclear about this issue in their price list?  Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue.  Afterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct. A funny one I noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD capability refer to the "auto inkjet" feature. This should have read "auto inject" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess that someone edited the copy, saw "inject" and thought it was a typo and changed it to the more familiar word "inkjet". Hmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of *writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)

I have a quick question regarding the Rockwell Chipset that's`come out relatively recently--It supports v.32, v.32bis, v.42, Group III Fax, and so on...  However, I heard there are bugs in the chipset.  I know someone that has a ZOOM 14.4 Modem that uses the chipset, and he hasn't had a problem. What's the word on the chipset?  Is this a ROM bug specific  to a specific brand using the Rockwell, or is it the Rockwell chipset itself?  And, if it is the Rockwell chipset, what  are the chances that if I buy one of these modems (using the Rockwell chipset), that a) the bug will affect me, b) a ROM change will fix/compensate for the bug?

: As far as I can tell, the MD is an offshoot of technology that already exists. : It is an MO drive.  MO drives exist already for computers.  They're expensive : and a bit slow, but the disks are cheep (128 mb disks).  Dan. I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply "MD is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data", then when pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD! What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio player prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program! -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------                 inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq 		"They didn't like the rates, they don't like the poll tax, 		 and they won't like the council tax."   - Nicholas Ridley   
Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional printer port. I have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port 0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie "0" for output, "1" for input). The same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work. For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.

Hi Folks. As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with icons which your application doesn't specifically own. In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in  my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes any difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE. Thanks - Scott :)

Any suggestions or comments? >------------------------------------------------------------------------------- >------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ben, Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works, the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area. I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help. I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free. If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.  If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction. Hope this helps, Murray   --  Murray M.

I have WD1007-WA2 ESDI controller with ROM BIOS v.1.1. It has been working fine until I recently upgraded motherboard to 386-40MHz. Now, my Maxter drive goes crazy making lots of seeking sound even when the drive is not accessed.  Of course, with numourous hard disk controller errors. These symptoms disappear when I switch to non-turbo mode (8 MHz). I suspect some timing dependent Rom Bios routines. (There's a newer version 2.x) Could anybody help me on this? By the way, my new mother board has AMI Bios, 128k Cache, 8 MHz bus, and works fine with my old MFM drives (I had to dig them up). :-( Also, I will appreciate it very much if somebody send me the phone numbers (tech support/BBS) for Western Digital. Many thanks in advance. Jay --
try this after XCreateWindow: ----------------------------- #include <X11/Xutil.h> Display display; Window window; {   XSizeHints *xsizehints = XAllocSizeHints ();   xsizehints->flags = USPosition | USSize;	/* or = PPosition | PSize */   xsizehints->x = 42;   xsizehints->y = 42;   xsizehints->width = 100;   xsizehints->height = 100;   XSetWMNormalHints (display, window, xsizehints);   XFree (xsizehints); } These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these values. If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize, this tells the window manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user. I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if you specify the position and size like above. Greetings from Berlin,

Hi, I just inherited an NCR 1204 external floppy.  This thing has every port known to man on the back. The question is: Does anyone know how to connect this thing to a PC. What hardware is needed? Software? TIA, Alex P.S. please respond directly.  I am not on this alias.
Hi! I recently switched my 3.5" drive to A:. The problem is, while I can read and write to both the new A: and B: correctly, I can't boot from a floppy in A:. I've checked the CMOS settings; it is set for Floppy Seek at Boot and Boot  Order A:,C:.  Once, I had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in A:. I got a message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive. It didn't work. When I do have a systems disk in the A: drive, this is what happens: 1) Power-on and Memory Test; 2) A: light comes on 3) B: light comes on, followed by a short beep; 4) HD light comes on for an instant; 5) B: light comes on again, then nothing happens The light goes off, there is no disk activity of any kind, and the screen  blanks. I can't even use ctrl-alt-del. Any suggestions. Thanks in advance. Eric Balog 
I need help positioning the slider of a List widget's horizontal scrollbar.  I am displaying the full path of a selected file in a list widget.  The horizontal's slider defaults to the left side of the list widget; however, I need the slider on the right side.  This is so the user can SEE the file name they selected.  I know it's possible, because when files are displayed in a file selection dialog box, the slider is on the right side. Thanking any and all who can help in advance, Rodney F. Clay
Does anyone know exactly how Digital Eclipse does their upgrades?  Someone was suggesting to me that some chips may not be able to perform at 33MHz.  Is this true, and if so, how does DESI deal with that? -David **** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

:  :    Oh yeah, I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a :    high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitors.(the Sony :    1604S for example) and this is where the extra cost comes from.  It :    is also where the high bandwidth comes from, and the fantastic :    image, and the large image size, etc, etc... :  : It's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third : down, the other two thirds down) come from. :  The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube, these 2 wires will be found on all 17" trinitron tubes (e.g., Mitsubishi 17", Sony 1604, etc).  On 14" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire. Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the sharpness of the T560i that I don't even notice the lines. The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube, has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in  a flatter screen than other 17" monitors using the standard trinitron  (which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and  apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.   -- ,----------------------,------------------------.---------------------, `----------------------'------------------------'---------------------' | Bell-Northern Research, P.O.Box 3511, Stn C, Ottawa, Ont., K1Y-4H7  | `---------------------------------------------------------------------'

Help appreciated.   A 256K DRAM chip is a 256 kilobit chip whereas a 256K SIMM is a 256 kilobyte memory module. The SIMM is a PCB with a 30 pin connector edge and on the SIMM are 8 256 kilobit DRAM chips (making the total memory 256 KBytes.     You are correct assuming that SIMMs will not fit into a LaserWriter. Apple printers either require 64 pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or special memory chips. Contact your Apple dealer to find out exactly what kind of chips you need. Peter Hansen Bell Northern Research
I recently upgraded to System 7.1 and now I also upgraded my DeskWriter drivers from 2.2 to 3.1.  I got the software from Sumex, but it is not clear to me where to install what. Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW-3.1 go where and for what purpose?  What can be left out, for instance, if you don't want to do background printing?

Dear Xperts:   I want to place a specific group of icons in an icon box and have my other icons appear outside of the box.  Does anyone know if there's a way I can do this??  I'm using X11R5 and Motif 1.2.1. Thanks!
Hi folks I'm planning to buy a LCIII but need advice on choosing a monitor. What do people recommend for a decent 14"/15" monitor?   I'v looked at some ads and the spec for NEC 4FG/4FGe and the price is  within my budget, but could LCIII be able to use the various resolutions  available on 4FG (specifically the 1024x768 resolution)? Does LCIII only  support one resolution? Also any recommendations for a reliable mail order place for LCIII or monitors? Does anyone have experience with the following mail-order places?

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for "cheap", but I cannot get the source for "cheap", hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself).   Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.   The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of "free", doesn't it?     Cheers,     Tom McConnell --   Intel, Corp. C3-91     |     Phone: (602)-554-8229  5000 W.

	alone and may not represent the views of the IBM PC User Group. See subject. An opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?). I am looking for a commercial/PD graphics editor with fairly limited abilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets. It must run on HP-UX version 9, either with or without the PEX extension. The sort of things I want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects such as lines, rectangles and text. Bounding rectangle operations are sufficient for object selection. Ideally it should also allow the creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g. text entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory. Does anyone have such an animal? If you do, please mail me with details including price (especially run-time licensing since it must be included in a product). Alternatively, send glossies to me at Logica, 68 Newman Street, London W1, including technical info please. For PD stuff, I have some effort that could be put into porting. Thanks for any help, Nicholas Young. --  Nicholas Young (+44 71 637 9111)

Begging everyone's pardon, I was not slamming Motif, nor was I necessarily  plugging/flaming the two.  I was responding to the sweet blithe statement in: rick> This is one area where Microsoft NT has a big advantage.  Since rick> they control the whole show, there are no issues like this where rick> licensees create incompatible defacto standards. This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not, by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience), and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as mentioned before, the "socialistic masses" that were bent on destroying  _anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are  no de facto standards. It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds. Mrs. Henne
