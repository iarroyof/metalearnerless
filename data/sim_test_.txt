It's a long card that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans.  It requires no extra cabling.  I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to heat.  The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no longer appears.  It's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range of 75-95 degrees Fahrenheit.  According to the maker's (M.S. Tech) advertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running (w/o a/c) in Desert Storm.  I can't vouch for that.  However, I am a satisfied customer.  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order house (Lyben  (313) 268-8100).

Well, thanks largely to subscribers of this group, here's xrastool 1.0, the animation package I started just over 3 weeks ago. A number of the solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in the code, so have a look! The full blurb has been posted to comp.windows.x.announce. This post is in two parts. To unpack the source code, extract the articles into file1 and file2 (for example). Use a text editor to remove leading and trailing text at the "---cut here---" markers (including the markers themselves). Next type "cat file1 file2 > file", then "uudecode file" and "zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -". Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there. Enjoy! Derek P.S. The source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib/ directory. If there is enough demand, a static binary will be provided for those without the XView libraries or include files. ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

If you write a custom error handler which does not do "exit(1);" the error handler will return and let your program carry on.

They realised that spending two years on numbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex injection-molded cases was not the way to go, and was holding up development work. Especially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery cover, and it had to be redone. That's why the portable was about three years late.

Chip Merchant confirmed that they > presently sell only composite 72-pin SIMMs.  So, Q-800 SIMMs need to be > both 60 ns and non-composite. 8 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs, although many (most?) 16 MB  SIMMs are.  72-pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM, thus permitting  the use of 4 Mb DRAM devices (the same ones used on 4 MB SIMMs) to be used  for two 4 MB banks on one SIMM.  I can't imagine that it would be cheaper  to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and  exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.   It's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts -  this could cause problems in a Q800.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do  this, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a  single-bank composite one. - Dale Adams

What version of WinFAX do you have?  The newest version (3.0) has an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) built in... what this means is that it can take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ASCII so that one can edit the document w/o re-typing it... However, I found that the OCR that comes packaged with WINFAX does not work as well as OMNIpage Professional (also by Delrina software)... So, once again, WinFAX ver. 3.0 has what you are looking for... Good luck! >Regards, >ZiZi

Think! It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to. An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data. On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. >  > Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book, > but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93): >  > "The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers." > I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.   > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT > HDD controller doesn't!?!?

I've built xcoral on my system (SunOS 4.1.3, X11R5, Motif 1.2, OW 3.0) and it builds fine, but when I run it, any child windows that xcoral opens, 1) locks the mouse into the window area 2) doesn't accept any input from the mouse. Needless to say, this is a pain in the ass, as I have to go find an empty terminal to login and kill xcoral. Is this a problem with OpenWindows or Motif?

Forgive me if this is stupid, but didn't I see a rumor somewhere that Apple was working on an Intel platform OS.  Say like system 7 for 80X86's? Chris
When I changed from SVR4 to SVR4.2 on my Intel box I discovered that some of my SVR4 xclients such as xload, etc would no longer work. They bomb out with the message: error: can't open display unix:0.0 Is this because they can't find the correct shared libraries, they need to be recompiled, or have I not used the correct options? Both systems use X11R5. Thanks. Jack.

I believe that that would be the same as a system error #64. Since there is no error #64, then I would guess that it would be a -64 error. Which is a font manager error of "error during font declairation". I would assume that the system that's on the floppy that you are trying start up on has a corrupted font in it, or something like that.

I'm writing a driver that needs to remap some I/O ports.  This means virtual mode.  Unfortunately virtual mode means it won't get along with expanded memory managers, so I need make it an EMM driver too. Does anyone out there have EMM code.  Can any point me to an EMM code source? -Thanks, Morgan --
Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5" hard drive, model LPS240A, and have a concern about its behavior. Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to file I/O, it performs what I call phantom seeks. When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in the drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, not the drive.] My other hard disk, a Seagate ST3283A, does not have this kind behavior. Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon? -- --------------------- 				HPG200/11 				(408) 447-5580 ---------------------
Hiyas ALL, Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend, I  couldn't wait to install it. I had gotten an advertisement for it and put  it aside  with my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load.  No part of  the software would load even though the install went seemingly well. 	I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty  million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of  the  systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're  willing to  give me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their  support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings  of  Windows 3.1.  	After my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned  some of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop  Animator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of  .dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and >  100K the  other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied  with Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll   to a  directory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll  in my  Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.)

I posted on here about a problem with a Datadesk 101e keyboard that failed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressed or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key.  After absolutely no help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech support.  They tried it out on their Centris 610 and had the same problem.  They immediately offered to get a new keyboard, try it on their Centris and ship it to me overnight if it worked.  I could send them my keyboard back after I got the one that worked.  This is from a guy in Tech support named Dave. It turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command-option.  I really like this keyboard so I was glad to be able to keep it.  On the other hand, Datadesks tech support sucks while MacConnection's is great! -Terry
Microsoft is the largest software company on the planet, yet I cannot think of even *ONE* computing concept that they innovated and brought to market before anyone else.  Xerox-PARC/Apple, Osborne, NeXT, GNU and others have  been pioneers and led the way to the future of computing.  What has microsoft done to be a technological leader?  I posted this question before, but I got nary a reply.  I make the challenge now to anyone who can come up with something-especially Microsoft employees.  I get no response this time, I guess it pretty much assures me that there is none--which is what I suspect anyway. ###################################################################### Kurt D.

    The IRQ and interface-select jumpers are pretty straightforward, but I     don't grok the settings of W10-W18 (also labelled A15 through A18).     Could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond     to what I/O addresses?      The U-B PCNIC (also OEMed by IBM for a while) is the only Ethernet card I know of that doesn't use I/O addresses.  It only has interrupts and shared memory.  The jumpers you see control bits 15-18 in the base address of the shared memory.  I can't recall which is 1 and which 0, but that's easy to determine with DEBUG. James B.

Hi, I have the following problem: I have to use a computer for special purposes that doesn't have a monitor and keyboard connected. No monitor isn't a  program - but no keyboard. I can't disable the keyboard from BIOS setup (in fact, there is no setup). I spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the BIOS with simply using a self-made connector that connects two pins via a resistor. Pity, pity... I lost contact to the person before getting more detail. So does anyone of you experts can help? Thanks for any hints, even vague ones :-) Thomas --  Thomas S.

Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System ------------------- If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style like this... // mini sample application ///////////////////////////////////// class Test : public XmWindow { 	void cmd(char*); 	void quit(void*); public:     Test() : XmWindow("Xm++ Test Window") {} 	void initialize(); }; void Test::initialize() {     XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu();     menu->addLabel("&File");     menu->addItems( Entry("Menu Item &One", CB(Test::cmd)),                      Entry("Menu Item &Two", CB(Test::cmd)),                     NULLENTRY);     menu->addSeparator();     menu->addItem(	Entry("E&xit", CB(Test::quit)));     addSubpane(Edit, "myEdit");     edit("myEdit")->setText("Hello World."); } void Test::cmd(char* n) { 	edit("myEdit")->setText(n); } void Test::quit(void*) { 	exit(0); } void XmApp::initialize() {     (new Test)->initialize(); } /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README): Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11 and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets. Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both environments without changes, although many nice features are only available when using Motif. In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases. Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version, which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications (in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-). Top level objects in Xm++: * 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout   feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw * 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface   builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this   distribution) Controls (children of top level objects): 'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton', 'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar' The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text. Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects. CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system (research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices). If you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of the art' from 1991). CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also. Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed. About this first release: Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes. CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications.

>Besides the faster processor, the 950 has SCSI 2, and as far as I know, >faster I/O due to separate processors handling those functions.     Mostly. The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI chip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2 modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI performance over the Q900. It does, howrever, have a faster I/O controller than the Q900; this is where the real speed boost comes from. -Hades

Here's another question by a hesitant Powerbook purchaser. I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments   from the gallery about this. How much slower does the program run on a   machine without an FPU (namely a PB160) versus a machine with an FPU   (namely a PB170).  What types of calculations get bogged down the most. I   primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with   analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. I don't do a lot of   numerical work. Would a PB160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice   video port ) be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this   type of work? Is a PB170 with 8Mb faster than a PB160 with 12 or 16Mb. All comments appreciated.

Here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server.   The WinHelp() function, as I am told by MS, does search your path so  relocating MS windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include the path to where you move them to, however, if an application has  hardcoded the path into their code so that when WinHelp is invoked it searches the given path (i.e. WinHelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for example) then WinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory where you have installed your software. I tested this out on a variety of software packages.  I moved all my  helpfiles to the drive z:\ and included this in the path statement. Here is the results for different software packages: Norton Desktop			Found Helpfiles Windows V3.1 for WorkGroups	Found Helpfiles Windows V3.1			Found Helpfiles MS Powerpoint V3.0		Found Helpfiles MS Word				Found Helpfiles MS Excel V4.0a			Did Not Find Helpfiles (strange) MS Foxpro V2.5 for Windows	Found Helpfiles Lotus Amipro V3.0		Did Not Find Helpfiles Procomm Plus for Windows	Did Not Find Helpfiles I guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to  specify a global path for helpfiles.   If anyone has any comments or If I can help anyone or if I left something out please let me know. More info on this topic as it develops

I have a floppy drive which has developed "General failure" errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5" drive). I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now. However, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector. Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it. Thanks!

Here is the fixed patch: The patches for xv.h need to use ``#ifdef SVR4'' rather than the overly complex ``#if defined(sun) && defined(SYSV)'' in order to generically compile XV on i386SVR4Architecture.  Also, rand and srand don't work very well--use lrand48 and seed48 to get better results. Otherwise, xv-3.00 compiles just fine on my Esix System V 4.0.4 box with XFree86 and gcc-2.3.3.  I just uncommented the gcc definition in the Makefile, added -L/usr/X386/lib -I/usr/X386/include to the COPTS line and modified LIBS to include -lsocket -lnsl.

Hi, I just test installed kanjitalk 6.07 on my IIci  and got a black screen, a way sick looking mac icon, and when hitting the programmers reset, a tone sequence that I guess is the infamous "tones of death."  I was able to reboot off a floppy, removed the japanese system, and set up the system folder on the hard drive to get system 7.01 back. Now have no overt problems with the mac. Any idea what caused the tones?  I forget the numbers but 7fff comes to mind. If it is some self diagnostic, why would an older system version catch it, and not 7. ? (I'll be moving up to 7.1 and worldscript by-and-by) Thanks in advance, Hiroki -- Hiroki Morizono Department of Biochemistry		612.624.4938 University of Minnesota			612.625.5780 (fax) St Paul MN 55108
Subject: (none) We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs. These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps: - use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data   otherwise block (new data comes quite often) - use msgop to check for messages and if true read them   otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often) - update the display according to latest data and messages. We typically have several of these running in windows, plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag. Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run. Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into. O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time. We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc. The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate. Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt. The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready. We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o. Any suggestions or examples most welcome! We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems.

Judging from the responses so far, I have not made clear enough in my article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX, but for *using* it. With Imake-TeX, you will never again have to fiddle around with calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). Simply type "make" and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable Makefile for you. Here is such an Imakefile: 	#include "TeX.tmpl" 	PaperFormatA4() 	SimpleLatexTarget(document) The generated Makefile provides the following commands:     make depend:    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like                     \input{somefile}     make dvi:       Generate an up-to-date DVI file     make viewdvi:   Display it on your screen     make ps:        Generate a PostScript version of your document     make viewps:    Display it     make clean:     Remove unnecessary things     make veryclean: Remove even the DVI file If ... a) ...this seems attractive to you, b) ...you are willing to test Imake-TeX and send me a short test report, c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation    (however, the German version is completed and included), then you are invited as a beta tester.

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt). You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this is the hard part).  Then, in the callback that starts the drawing, you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time.  Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean... TRUE when you are finished, and FALSE when you want to keep processing.  If you return FALSE, the workProc is automatically re-installed.   Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop, since events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you are using the same Ada bindings I am, however, you are hosed, and should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt). ---------- Joe Hildebrand Software Engineer Fuentez Systems Concepts (703)273-1447 Standard disclaimers apply
When attempting to connect to an SGI Indigo from a PC clone using a commercial X windows emulation package, the X package hangs in a pre-login X screen mode.  The login box won't display.  Using the package in 'telnet' mode, I can logon to the SGI, and run any none graphic type things.  On the PC I get an error: "Read error 0 on socket 1"  (raw socket error) On the SGI, in xdm-errors: I get a termination error when I kill the stalled screen on the PC On the SGI, in SYSLOG: <date><time><SGI> xdm[#]:Hung in XOpenDisplay(<remote>:0, aborting   "                  "  :server open failed for <remote>:0, giving up I have all access control disabled (I believe, SYSLOG message confirms this when I login on the SGI).  I believe I have the SGI set up properly as described in the X ADm. book by O'Rielly.... The X emul package tech support hasn't been able to solve the problem. So what I'm looking for is some suggestions on where to look for problems, and possible tests to run to narrow down the questions. Thanks
Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC's on it, and is expecting to get a composite sync signal on the "green"?  There ought to be a little black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert, and composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and merges the green and composite sync together in the output.  It's all 1V analog, as far as I know.  I can build this with op-amps but I don't think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen. Does anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter? -- Paul Vixie, DEC Network Systems Lab	 Palo Alto, California, USA         	"Don't be a rebel, or a conformist;

I have a 486DX-33 ISA pc-compatible (Insight) with an Infotel internal 14.4FAX/14.4data modem with QuickLinkII for Windows.  When I first put the modem in, I pulled a phone out of the jack in another room, and ran a phone line extension to my surge protector and then my computer.  The modem worked fine.  Then I split the line from the jack in the other room, ran the line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer.  Then I got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem. Now when I try to use the modem, QuickLinkII says "No dialtone".  The phone plugged into the back of the computer works fine.  I tried unplugging the phone, but still no dice.  Is it that the phone line was split too many times?  (I don't understand how this could be a problem, since the phone worked fine.)  Please note: none of the software or hardware parameters were changed, only the phone line itself.

                          The Andrew Consortium           of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon                           is pleased to announce                           AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2                                  4/26/93 The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was developed for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other platforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory ./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5" diskette can be ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address below.  The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the same host. Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows AUIS to compile under AIX3.2. ----------- The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment on top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but also  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors, equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can themselves contain other objects, including text. AUIS has three components:     The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set     of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help     system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell     interface, and other editors corresponding to the various     available types of objects.      The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented     user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein     objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,     programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as     easily as those that come with the system.      The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface     to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail     management strategies and implements many advanced  features     including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of     mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails     of related messages, and subscription management. It also     provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and     low-function personal computers in addition to high-function     workstations.  The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences. Remote Andrew Demo Service You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11 window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and newsgroups. To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the following command on your machine: The service will give you further instructions.

I have done several of these upgrades (about 6 IIsi's, and 1 Quadra 700), and the best thing to use would be some sort of "heat sink compound". If possible, you should look for the silicon-free stuff. There's a comany who makes the stuff called Tech Spray, their address is: P.O. Box 949, Amarillo, TX 79105. You should be wary in using most kinds of tape; and definately don't use duct tape  that stuff is for ducts... When using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the small space between the heat sink and the CPU. Mario Murphy **** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

> The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, > along with heat. 	I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost) to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time.  This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the same kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off screens, reducing clock speed, etc.  The advantage of this over just turning the thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2) the machine is still available over the network. 	The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity. Certainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody pinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebody logs in via a telnet connection. 	I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter months; that energy is just getting turned into heat.  It may not be as efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it's not too bad.  In the summer though, it's a disaster.  Not only are you wasting that power, but you're probably also running the air conditioning to get rid of the waste heat. --  Hippocrates Project, Department of Microbiology, Coles 202 NYU School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016 "This never happened to Bart Simpson."

Jordan implemented the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for, call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a  OS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file tty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a  couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the  "drivers" actually included from the toplevel include file will be  compiled into emu. It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully relies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux system available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or questions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we  just don't have access to that many different systems.

>Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey's >Mac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it, offering >clean 32-bit ROM code (liberating his IIx from the virtual memory >nightmare caused by Apple's 32-bit System Enabler). [ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications as a self-styled "expert", in fact, when I read about anybody using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ] Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the  correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be  prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine  type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect  conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent and driver-related stuff. In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble  of ROM-swapping.  The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1. >Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?   Sure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics, Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price on a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might get a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother- boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway. >Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would >be a reasonably price to offer? Ask for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and Shreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade magazines often list considerably different prices for the  same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well. Still, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading  the ROM in a IIx.   --  -- 38 Chambers Street; Newark, DE 19711; (302)368-1949
Hello out there! My Mac IIsi runs a Radius Pivot LE monitor, with the PDS card. As I wanted to try to switch to 32 bit adressing, i couldn't startup my Mac anymore. 1.	What is the trick to zap the PRAM (so I won't have to take out the battery next time) 2.	Is there any trick that could allow me to switch to 32bit? 3.	What does 32bit adressing bring to me as an user? faster work? 4.	Any chance to have more than 8Mb of adressable memory with 24bit adressing? Thank you a lot for your answers (via mail or reply) Ralph Schwegler, University of St.Gallen, Switzerland
>>Yes, I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on. But what >>about monitors? They generate a lots of heat. Should I or shouldn't I >>keep them on 24 hours a day? Any advice?     Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially if you have a large (16" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my office. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being displyed on the monitor's tube. >Actually, I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day.     Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office has been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn't had any when I'm not actually working on the server itself.) -Hades

I have a SPARC-2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it.  I'd like to have the R5 server recognize the second card. I mknod created a /dev/cgsix1 device, but when I brought up the server, the second device was ignored.   How do I setup the second card? a cgsix card in the same SPARC-2 box, the R5 server finds the second card. I then set the DISPLAY to the second card, and start a second window manager.   Worse case is I trade cards with someone, but maybe someone out there has seen this problem already... email is preferred... post if you must... Thanks in advance....

I posted a message here some time ago asking why my mouse was so jumpy.   Well, I think I know why, and it doesn't have anything to do with the  mouse.  It seems to be the video driver!  Here's why I think that: A few weeks ago I helped a guy install the driver for his S3 video card for  windows.  He had been using the normal Windows default VGA driver.  We don't  have the same kind of mouse (mine is microsoft serial and his is an off- brand serial mouse).  His mouse worked fine until I installed the S3 (v1.4)  driver on his system, then his mouse became really jumpy too! Is there anything I can do?  I need high resolution since I display LOTS of  stuff on my screen (AMI Pro, Pegasus Mail for Windows, WP Office 4.0 --  sorry, nondisclosure!, and alot more).  I noticed there are S3 drivers on  ftp.cica, but they are the same version that I already have and they are no  help (I already tried!). --- Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications D-406 HFAC Brigham Young University Provo, UT  84602 (801)378-3292

Frequently-asked questions about the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface. If your question isn't here, please try (at *least*) 	man openwin 	man xnews 	man 7 xview and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the Bibliography below before posting to the comp.windows.open-look, comp.windows.x or alt.toolkits.xview newsgroups and/or their corresponding mailing lists. Special Notes:     * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4,       due to ship later this year.     * Yes, Sun is moving to Motif, along with all of COSE.  But the Motif to       which they move will be a new Motif, with some of the OPEN LOOK UI       features added.     * Yes, OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS.  NeWS is dead.       This means TNT is dead, too.     * XView and OLIT will be supported, but probably not enhanced after the       next release.  I don't know if there will be a source release of       XView 3.1 or not.     * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet,       ported to Motif.  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool, at least.     * Yes, the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant. Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly. Contents: (in rn and trn you can use control-G to go to the next topic)     OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).     A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of     windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you     edit files, etc.     The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by     Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?).     See Also: 	Bibliography     OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK     Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the     X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,     so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.     It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.     OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the     program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.     It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as     these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.     A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,     plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.     The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are: 	SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0 	Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0 	Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1     See Also: 	Mixing X11 and OpenWindows 	Where can I get it?     These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs     that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography     for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:     OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;     it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were     already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,     although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the     OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in     System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in     OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a     division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).     Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably     want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or     anything else that uses subclasses.     [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]     XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in     programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help     migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be     the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.     The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is     available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).     The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.     Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the     XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be     included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.     On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much     attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.     The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based     on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the     OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of     an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.     The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some     incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to     supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time     later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.     You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the     answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.     Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.     The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++     class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from     DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify     event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be     compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the     release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.     UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of     various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in     the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).     It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that     is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of     Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-     commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold     reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on     more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly     used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a     large installed base.     Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif     applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in     the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.     MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between     a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V     Release 4.2.     Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X     in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed     hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a     very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously     being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it     has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less     complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.     Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;     what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.     Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS     extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to     ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.     (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts     available, however)     They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window     system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows     on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.     Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.     It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and     you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.     Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the     `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the     currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can     move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This     lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around     from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm     by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.     Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib     directory; there are three patches).     Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use     the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the     footers some windows use to display certain messages.     If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus     and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run     under olwm.     For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc: 	LeftTitleButton "target" = f.delete     where "target" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.     Alternatively, try 	# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm 	LeftTitleButton ":menu" = f.menu "OL.menu" 	menu "OL.menu" { 	    "Quit"         f.delete 	}     For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title     bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).     See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).     The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.     This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.     Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS     or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes     pageview in particular.     You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-     Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)     will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about     fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.     If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you     XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.           .xinitrc and .xsessionrc     The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in     your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to     edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files     you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.     If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,     since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.     .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys     These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,     depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.     Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files     without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need     to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an     X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,     shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's "contool" program so that     system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.     Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.     .Xdefaults     You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,     it is a good idea to include at least: 	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true     These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they     forget to ask for it.     Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default     root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.     Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.     .startup.ps     This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)     on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the     back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change     the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a     syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up     at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code     that is both incorrect and insufficient.     WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.     Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see     the man page for xset ("man xset", and "xset -help") for more information.     Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of     about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of     twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for     OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime     is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to     process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your     SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3... 	% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual 	% /IncludeDemos? false def 	UserProfile begin 	    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def 	    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def 	end     You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this: 	/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage 	/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage 	/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage 	ClassRepeatKeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload 	endpackage endpackage endpackage     If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the     OpenWindows server like this: 	$ psh -i .startup.ps 	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 	$ psh -i 	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 	/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send 	%%% now press control-D     You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make     the root window be "retained", so that a PostScript drawing on the     background won't be erased when you move windows: 	frambuffer /Retained true put     will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used     by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.          See also: 	Environment Variables     You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one     or two occasional surprises.  See also "man 7 xview" for a list of     keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.     With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings     and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should     tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this     in your .xinitrc:     if eval `svenv -env`     then 	xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3" 	input_from_defaults     else 	xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"     fi     Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but     effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.     Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as     it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system     run screenblank automatically.     To go from XTerm to textedit (say):     * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button       in xterm     * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly       XView manual gets this wrong)     * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)    To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:     * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY     * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).     * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.     Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:     * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go     * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button     * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined       or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)     * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.     * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.     Drag and Drop to Move a Selection     * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-       clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button     * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection     * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse       pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the       first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).     * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want       to drop the text     * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show       that it's OK to drop things here     * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.	This works in text fields of       dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.     Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection     * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that       you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.     See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.     In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when     shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the     right of the insert point. 	Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward) 	Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word 	Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word 	Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line 	Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document     See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default     keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.     See the manual page for shelltool.     Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,     which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_     Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.     Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular     OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor     concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full     product documentation.     SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which     contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as     well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.     There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists     copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a     faster reply.     Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.     If "man cm_delete" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under     The best way is:     $ cd     $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .     $ chmod +w .textswrc     edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)     add the follwing: 	KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER 	cat ~/.signature     (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)     Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.     Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).     Or, Not Yet, in other words.     If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.     The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and     comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is     interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the     Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on     the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.     You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably     other major foundries.     SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.     Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as     fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes     that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache     parameters.	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the     font cache size. 	$ psh -i 	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you 	currentfontmem =	% type this line ... 	300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes 	1024 setfontmem 	% Just to check: 	currentfontmem = 	1024     See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.  You need to say psh -i     so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page. 	$ mkdir $HOME/myfonts 	$ cd $HOME/myfonts 	$ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b 	Creating Bembo20.afb 	$ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb 	Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb 	Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied. 	$ ls 	Bembo20.afb	Bembo20.fb	Synonyms.list 	$ bldfamily 	$ xset +fp `pwd` 	$ xset fp rehash     If you want the server to see your new font directory every time,     add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one     of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile.     You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server, by converting them to a     bitmap (X11 bdf format) first.  Your licence forbids you from using the     fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't     use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and     convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or     bdftopcf.     Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to     X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows.     You can also use der Mouse's "getbdf" to get bdf fonts from a running     X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf     There aren't any.  More precisely, the various text fonts, such as     Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are     scalable under OpenWindows.	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't     scale very well.     If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are     running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable: 	MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH     or 	setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man     for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems.     These messages all come from SunView programs.  SunView was an     earlier windowing system for Suns, and was not networked.  Some of     the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin, and have names     that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts.  You almost     certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead.     Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for     OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same), or     you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool, cmdtool, shelltool, etc.     If you get this from the binder, or if binder vanishes suddenly,     get the following patches: 	100493-02 Binder 	100524-03 Cetables 	100626-03 Tooltalk       If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), contact your local     Sun office and request the following patches: 100512-02   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu     If you can't install the patch, a workaround is to add  	-u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass     on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line.  An alternative is to add 	-assert nodefinitions     to CFLAGS in your Makefile, or even in Imake.tmpl.     It is a good idea to include at least: 	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true     in your .Xdefaults file, as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to     receive input even if they forget to ask for it.     See the next item for editing .Xdefaults     Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your     $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead: 	XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \ 		<Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\ 		<Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)        You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing     L8 (the Paste key)!     Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it     isn't working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to 	/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S     and if it isn't, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from     $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.     [See also: Environment Variables]     This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard: 	XTerm*VT100.translations: #override\n\ 	    <KeyPress>L8: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)      be no following spaces, and any + or | signs showing that this FAQ file      was altered must also be removed!]     If you are using X11R5, you may find that adding the lines <Key>L10: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\        <KeyRelease>L10: kill-selection() \n     before the <KeyPress>L8 line will make L10 (CUT) work as a cut key!     If you alter $HOME/.Xdefaults instead, you must use what X calls a     `more specific' resource name: 	xterm.vt100.translations     will do.     If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard, you can     use Meta-x, Meta-c and Meta-v for cut, coy and paste respectively.     You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to     your .Xdefaults file, edited as you wish (the values shown here are the     defaults): 	OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste", "v+Meta,L8          Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview, and also in the     thinnish blue book `Companion to Volume 7, XView Reference Manual' from     O'Reilly, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages.     Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps; see also the     next item.     Oh dear.  Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running     and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started     OpenWindows with "openwin" or by logging in through xdm.     If not, start it.  If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc     before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can     reboot your workstation.     Check that there is space in /tmp (use "df /tmp"), and also see if there     are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are     several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out.     Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start     a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files     that are still there.  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again     after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working     again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you     might be in use by another worker comrade, so don't remove those without     checking first!     If you get error messages that look like     try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11, 	xhost +machine     where "machine" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed.     If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you,     using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking 	xhost +`hostname`     (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation).     This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display.     With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer's Guide      describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101.  This is more secure.     Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the     framebuffer directly!     Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1     to fix a serious security problem.  It is available through your local     Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net     [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist:     Fix                     PatchID        Filename            Checksum     loadmodule              1076118        100448-01.tar.Z     04354  5     On an X Terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or     disable the list of hosts that can access the display.     If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight,     there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in /tmp     that are used to communicate with the server when $DISPLAY doesn't have     a hostname before the :, or is empty.  Have the system administrator     change the cron script to skip sockets.     If "refresh" makes the messages vanish, but new ones come along later, 	you need to run "xterm -C" from your .xinitrc, or start one up in 	the background and then  choose Save Workspace from the 	Workspace->Utilities menu.  Better still, pick up "contool" and run 	that.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It 	will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a 	message appears; it's very easy to configure.     If "refresh" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages,     go away... 	a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the 	mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto 	a whole new (but monochrome) display, called ":0.1".  See the man. 	page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and, 	if there's a /dev/cgfour0, does 		openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 	If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this 	to your .xinitrc or other startup file: 	( 	    eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env` 	    olvwm -display unix:0.1 	) & 	Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically. 	You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also, see 	the note about contool, above.     Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.     This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your     .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.     Keep comments by using "comment." instead of "!", for example, 	comment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37     set the default editor to 	sh -c "exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \"$FILE\""     (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)     This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.	 With OpwnWindows 3.0,     there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're     using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of     upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.     A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.     A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output     that's broken, not the actual check-box code.     This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're     still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;     the new one is fantastic!   on the screen.     Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in     the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin').     This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to     use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.          Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37     respectively in OpenWindows 3.  Applications must be recompiled, or you     might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to     change your keyboard layout back again.     (see also next item)     (see also next item)     Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch     level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to     OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with     OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.     Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.	You can intermix OpenWindows     and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.     Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.     Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions     of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a     matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory     first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have     /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in     your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead     of OpenWindows ones!     Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11     library directory.	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with     older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't     do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although     xdm core dumps if this isn't right.     Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't     /usr/openwin.     See Also: 	Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).     set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use 	     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib     If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use     ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for     /bin/sh; for csh it is different.     Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches     and install the patch.     You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.	It won't run under     X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw     the PostScript text and pictures.     If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0     compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.     If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace     navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to     satisfy your sense of paranoia!)     The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.     Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with     a PostSript viewer (q.v.).     A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from     ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z     It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties     Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.     Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also     works if you run command tool on a remote machine.     Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.     Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be     selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted     in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus.     To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:     You can change the color using (for example) 	*List*inputFocusColor: <your background color>     See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set     Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation.     Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the     OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch.   I move into a different window! ("colormap flashing")          This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.     However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:     *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.     *  Run 	cmap_compact save        to create the .owcolors file     *  Put the line 	cmap_compact init        near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)     *  Exit and then restart the window system.     *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of 	the colormap and reserves them.     Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and     Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.     This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif     window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.     Try running pageview like this: 	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono 	$OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview 	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard     Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'.     Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.     SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in 	svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic     because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables.     Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security     hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your     users can access files and start Unix processes ass root...     In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names ("keysyms") for these keys was changed     to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.

Note that there is also a usenet     newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it doesn't sem to have very     wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles     per month.	You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x.     PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle.     PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles.     There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.     You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you     insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function     insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits.     In the button callback, do         xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL);     This will keep the window visible.     You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute.     call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are     documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source...

I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to  install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access).  Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the  problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow! Thanks for your help. Yours Markus

I'm looking for recommendations for a laser printer.  It will be used mostly for text by a single user.  It doesn't need to be a postscript printer.  Any advice would be appreciated.
	I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell network (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was set up to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say, I'd like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network. 	Basically, the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but several DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'd mainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and perhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could live without it. 	Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working with the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that leaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd be Norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself. 	As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I've read through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'd like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area. 	Please reply by Email. I don't scan these newsgroups often. 	Thanks for any replies.

But people like me can't afford them. It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models.. but they are just that...low end.

If u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  But for the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware that it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..

I am planning on upgrading my old XT compatible system with a new motherboard, hard drive, and 1.4 MB floppy. I am interested in using my old power supply (150 W) to power the new hardware, if possible.   I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probably use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard. (Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only 11 wires -- the 12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery). My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire out of an 11 wire supply OR using an auxiliary power source to charge the motherboard battery? I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can  make use of my existing one with simple hacks. Thank you for any information.   -Larry Arbanas
A friend and I have ATI Graphic Ultra display adaptors, and they have been reasonably good performers, but we both have had irritating compatibility problems with the ATI drivers and are ready to change to something faster and more compatible with windows.

One way to "mask" the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the show_mouse_position function.  If the XEvent arrive in this function as  XEvent p_event; then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So,  you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int.  By the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with  these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In  essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button.  Unfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the  value of the pressed button. Any ideas, eps

I am having a really bothersome problem using the MSDOS prompt in Windows 3.1 to open a dos box.  When I am done with the dos box, I cant get back to windows. If I do Alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it, the screen goes black and I have to control-alt-delete until I kill windows.  I get a couple of screens about app not responding. I think things are still alive under the black screen because if I alt-tab to cycle through the running apps, I get flashes of text but then the black returns. This persists even if the machine is powered on and off. I am working with an app developed using Borland's 3.1 application frameworks and c++.  It seems to work fine. Hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network.  Video is a TSENG  vga.  dos 5.0. I reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back.  I am using temporary swapping for virtual memory. I would really REALLY appreciate any hints anyone might offer. Thanks, Jim Cant

     this is a repost... I like to find out more about this also... *** Message Part 2: Text **************************************** The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common GUI. But what does this mean exactly?   - Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will have the Motif   look and feel?   - Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will use the Motif   toolkit API?   - Do they mean both of the above?   - Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with   an OpenLook Look & Feel?   - How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F?   (I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?)   - Will there be more than one "standard" toolkit API or L & F supported?   - How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif?   This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much knowledge about these questions off the net... Feel free to e-mail or followup.   -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Gil Tene "Some days it just doesn't pay     - --------------------------------------------------------------------

I have just added a Panasonic KP-X1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx/25. I installed the appropriate Windows 3.1 printer driver (i.e. one specifically for this printer) but I'm unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly.    What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly. My experiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from Corel Draw) print ok. GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc. MS Notepad and MS Write will print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts.    When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change  the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated.   I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates, namely Epsom LQ-850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs.   If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, I would be most  chuffed.     David H.  

Looking for a Mac PB 100 that's in good condition (brand new, w/warranty would be ideal).  It should also include the external floppy drive and have at least a 40 MEG internal hard drive with 4 MEG of RAM. So... if you have a PB100 that you'd like to turn into cash, please write me. Thanks, very much. -- Billyb (** Bouncer **)

It seems silly, but while I've located things like tgif that can  edit gif  files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, I haven't been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a gif file in it.  I've looked thru various faq files, also to no avail. Is there one lurking about in some  archive?   Nothing  sophisticated; just "show the pretty picture"? Alternatively, if I could locate the specs for gif, I don't suppose it would be too hard to write it myself, but I have no idea where to even start looking for the spec.

Hi, I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running  SunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment variables (like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc) in my .login file.  With xdm, the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm root-window nor my applications know about these variables. I used the "DisplayManager._0.userPath" resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config to succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession but that didn't help.  I also tried using which didn't work either. I would appreciate any help on this matter.

  {deletions} > the "attached" fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential > loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you > can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing. >  Yes, this is a valid concern IMHO.  With the directly attached fan units I've seen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be  a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words, if the fan stops the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage, not just stop working temporarily. > I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel > to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though. >  My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu, and it's located so the front fan, which sucks air into the case, blows right on the heat sink.  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise.  Essentially the  arrangement you're talking about and a good idea IMHO. > on-chip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 30.00.

If you have defined  a project root and done a make install, everything should have gone right by default, even without symbolic links. Casper
I've got an IN-2000 working in a (wimpy) 386SX20 presently.  In a few months I'm getting a 486 motherboard and probably a Toshiba 3401e CDROM and a SBPro. Will I need special drivers for getting all this to work?  Do they exist? Basically, is this feasible, or should I expect to be getting a newer,  faster SCSI card? thanks, -Bryan --  Everything will perish save love and music.--Scots Gaelic proverb
Dear Netters,      My friend have brought a S3801 card with 2Mb RAM. Is there any new driver  for the card available on ftp cites? What is the newest version?

Is there an "official extension" to X which allows the use of audio? Most of the X audio programs use system-specific ways to access the audio capabilities of the computer they run on.

>Even so, my point still stands to an extent [...] that 64k limits appear all >over the place where they really are not necessary, such as the edit control >limit. While the 64K limit may not be _necessary_ limitation, they probably fall within the category of 'reasonable' limitations.  If you find yourself trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64K of text, it's probably time take a good look at your program's design. >Why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory >handles allowed? In what way is 8192 a 'small' number?  It seems to me that you'd hit the wall in many other ways before you'd hit the systemwide limit on global handles, unless, of course, you're abusing GlobalAlloc. And _please_ don't try to tell me that it's impossible to abuse the resources available under other operating systems.  All systems have limits.  The question is whether or not the limits are _reasonable_.  So far, you haven't offered a single argument which suggests that Windows' limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems. --  Rick Schaut UUCP:...{uunet | uw-beaver}!microsoft!richs Microsoft doesn't speak for me, and I don't speak for Microsoft.
Diamond Video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...)  may have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that come with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast, BUT: If you're considering buying a system, with a view to using it to run Unix (Linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special software, there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards. This is due to Diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware: it's impossible to get free information from them about their chips  (specifically their dot-clocks) without paying, and signing non-disclosure agreements. This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide X-Windows compatibility with these cards, as diamond didn't want to  divulge programming neccessities. As far as I know only Diamond has this propriety on it's info. Mark.

        I am looking for info on products that can take Windows source on a Unix box (such as Sparc), and produce a Motif executable.  Another requirement is that MFC 2.0 should be supported.

I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up to NOT remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens when bold is displayed.

I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice. First a general description of the machine as follows:       (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it)  Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256)  ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board  primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller  secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller  tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller  planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port  Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller   future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface.  Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board  (ugly dos software drives the latter) Applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quicken and Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audio work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo, and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files.  Also I use Stacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she  won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from  Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom  used offline files.   I plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly tempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around with the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the  shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can hope can't I, after all, I have work to do). The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and  hardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the  upgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I still need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?)  from some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation goes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'm allergic to command lines!  I plan to run a "pure" NT system.  Also, will  NT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently  have stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite  Disk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the  system (It's cramped now). I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT  version?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk will be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else) a comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask  Chili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd rather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without DOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around? Any feedback or advice (including "forget NT" with good reasons) is much appreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better multitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files), and I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe there are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing  about them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?) Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net. Thanks, Nathan Gregory

I was under the impression that people on the net had both   > SCSI and IDE working together. I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now. SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives (ESDI,RLL,IDE,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers to get it to work with odd environments. For information purposes, I had: ST-01 Card + ST296N drive and a MAXTOR 212a drive with generic IDE controller running together. I have also had the same SCSI setup work in combination with a RLL drive, the ST251-1 drive.

Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group  would be in a unique position to present the results of, say, research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps).

I have a problem with the wallpaper on my desktop, in 1024x768x256 mode.   For bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending  on the exact dimensions), the wallpaper display is badly corrupted.  The  rest of the desktop is fine.  For wallpaper bitmaps smaller than this, I  have no problem.  I have a friend who has an 800k bitmap which he has no  problems with, so it is possible.  It is also possible to display these bitmaps using CShow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video  card is not at fault. How can I remedy this? My system:      386DX40, 4Mb ram.

A friend of mine uses Windows 3.1 to do most of her work. Unfortunately, she has very bad eyesight, and we haven't been able to figure out how to change the default font used by the system and application menus, or the font used by the Help program (what use is hypertext if you can't read it?) to make it legible to her. If anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts, of any software package that makes Windows more accessible to visually handicapped people, please let me know. Thanks, 	Dan
              Any opinions expressed are strictly those of the               user and not necessarily those of Ericsson. My PC is a 486-33DX (ISA) with AMI BIOS and OPTI chipset. I am thinking of replacing the AMI BIOS chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). My questions are: 1. Do I just take out the old one and plug in a new? 2. Anything else I have to take care of? What precautions should I take? 3. Where can I get the new BIOS chip, CompUSA, mailorder or what? (I live in Orange County California). 4. What is the most up-to-date version? 5. Very important. How much would it be? Thank you for your help. Paul.
Subject: "speed" LED's for a gateway motherboard Hi, I recently got a tower-case for my Gateway 486/33 file server, mostly because we needed the extra drive bays and better power supply.  This case has LED's for the processor speed, i.e. 33.  Is there a place to plug this in on the motherboard?  If not, is there anyway to hack something to make it work?

>Do all SCSI cards for DOS systems require a separate device driver to >be loaded into memory for each SCSI device hooked up? No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better performance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks. >Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's? Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that are written for DOS, so you need software drivers. That's not a big deal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to fight with any low memory problems either. -- Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software

We are having problems with our Laserwriter print drivers going bad on various people's machines on our Appletalk network.  On our network, people have 7.0, 7.01, and 7.1 versions of the Laserwriter print driver.  We have been solving the problem by reinstalling the print driver, but it is time-consuming and a real pain. The Printmonitor software also seems to go bad frequently.  We have also just been replacing it (over and over, it seems) to keep things running. Does anyone out there have any ideas about what may be causing the printing software to go bad?  Are there known INIT conflicts or network conflicts?  I would appreciate communication about any similar experiences you may have had or ideas you have. thanks....karen

Out of 4 months of using Windows on my  >>new machine I've only had it crash ONCE, and I don't have a "run of the mill" >>configuration. 	[munch  following is reformatted] >It does sound funny, I will admit.  But for me it is true.  Windows > crashed on >all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not > the exception) 	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare. 	Windows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by 	an errant application (My personal favorite?  Any one of the Corel 	3.0 programs).  On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly 	a number of times, mostly just running it's own applications. 	For instance.  Today I discovered a new one.  While I was downloading 	with Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard 	VGA drivers on a run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that 	I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my  	.finger.  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless,  	I fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session.  Whoops, the download 	finished while WinOS/2 was loading.  It had _just_ gotten 	the pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop 	(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while). 	 	Blam.  Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up.  Hm.  Well, I can sorta 	see the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session  	and got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were 	off--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys). 	So I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored). 	PP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer  	"connected" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way-- 	it told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it 	was _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea.  	Shutdown and reboot. 	Ok, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed... 	Hm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  Let's see.. Ah, the  	windows list still comes up.  OK, let's try shutdown again. 	No go.  Huh. 	Alright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow. 	Hmm.  Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again. 	Nothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.  Enjoy the checkdisk time.    	In this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but 	OS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s 	been compromised, I guess).  In everyday (specifically _today_) 	use. > OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or >(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have. 	That's the idea, anyway.  In truth, when a program crashes on  	OS/2, it will bring the system down with it.  The programs that 	would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs 	that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt, 	task protection or no.   	For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed 	WP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  It works fine under DOS or even in 	a dos box under Windows 3.1.  (Admittedly, it doesn't crash if I run 	WP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard). >  If windows works for you, >then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of  >choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each >task, 	Please explain.  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is 	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even 	then, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per  	minute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing  > and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, 	Not sure what you mean here.  OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six 	of these for it's own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2).  	Windows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the 	disk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself.  If memory efficiency  	were a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the  	Intel desktop.   > some of the >key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it >would be more of an even fight. 	On the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence 	that both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to 	them.  For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine,  	while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows.  	(But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash  	install).  On the whole, I'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive 	than Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows 	just doesn't like.   >Wittism of th week: "I think that it's wrong to believe in an ism, you should >                     believe in yourself"  Ferrish Bueller  	 	Wasn't this _Ferris_ Bueller? --  There are stupid laws, and then there are stupider than normal laws.

I am looking at getting a laptop for work and I was trying to decide between the Toshibas and Gateway's Nomad.  The price is about the same,  but the Gateway has significantly better performance (200MB vs. 120MB  hard drive, 50Mhz 486DX2 vs.  25Mhz 486SL) and much cheaper accessories  (extra batteries, modem...) The concern I have about Gateway is the durability and reliability. Does anyone out there have any experience with the Gateway Nomad? Thanks, Denis Lambert

I ran out of time on my last reply to this string and I don't know if it was sent or not but. I have never heard of anyone that had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem. But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system. When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like you have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that. But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem. I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$ in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test bench. I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself. I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my card back for the modems after they had received them back...no I will not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co. co from Hayes.

(I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.) Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the pathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of "upgrading" to DOS 6 that I have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it. My envorinment ============== TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs After "updgrading" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things became so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In the process of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things. Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive ================================================== While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain applications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS) and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm). The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from factory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when "upgraded" to DOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew that DS compression must cost something. Specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually *improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than I/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings in I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large random writes, the transfers take up to three times as long. While the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or sequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on WinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed. The tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv on, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and slow disk I/O'. This explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long. Double Space and Windows ======================== DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you wanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that matter even check on its usage -- try "fasthelp dblspace" in a dos box within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you get.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder. Yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to file manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed floppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to.) DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM ============================================== Defragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm. This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used) but it took 12 minutes. I discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran faster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this had to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM) module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle, and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After disabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds. Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots ==================================================================== In the readme.txt file, you can find the the following 	Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers 	---------------------------------------------------------------- 	To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup 	for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in 	your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you 	run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt. If you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it means "disable all power saving features of your notebook".  Why would anyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only does TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the readme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what else) are crippled by the TI's power saver. It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If there indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI programmers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have to guess as to who are the idiots. By the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE in DOS6, when you check the status, it says: 	Power Management Status 	----------------------- 	Setting =  ADV: MAX 	CPU: idle 60% of time. This figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in iconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all for itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is such an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating system or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99% idle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative' example of our times! Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming =================================================== I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this: 	set PATH=C:\DOS 	... 	set PATH=C:\ETC\BIN;%PATH%;C:\BIN 	... 	set PATH=C:\ETC\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS 	... 	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BCC\BIN 	... 	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE% Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one (i.e. c:\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every path statement, and prepends C:\DOS to its value.  As a result, my resultant path has so many DOS's. If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add the new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path. (Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.) Instead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one) decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and prepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process. I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft representative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet. Now that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement with %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason? As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to understand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as: 	set MOUSE=C:\ETC\MOUSE 	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE% 	loadhigh %MOUSE%\MOUSE.COM Guess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with 	LH ... C:\ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its parameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand. DOS 6 Software Quality ====================== DOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage, you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it. I am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont within a week, I will post how you can create this "ghost" file. Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot) programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it -- that is what I was told how Microsoft "tests the quality" of their products. I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to "test quality" when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but can only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair! Also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the defragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated when I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since. Microsft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you admit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we should watch out for if we have already used DS.

Ok, I'm being driven batty. Trying to create popup-menus (ie. button3 press, and a menu appears).  I would really like to use the standard Athena classes to achieve this goal, but for my best attempts I cannot get the menus to come up without using a MenuButton as the parent of the widget tree.  I know this should be possible to to with an XtPopupSpringLoaded() and a little twiddling, but something is escaping me. --  affiliation: Extra Mile Consulting	   phone: +47 (83) 38663 quote: "Time has little to do with infinity and jelly donuts."

Does anybody have a data-sheet handly for the above-mentioned card?  I bought one, sans manual at a local surplus shop, and want to try it out with the Crywyr packet driver suite.   The IRQ and interface-select jumpers are pretty straightforward, but I don't grok the settings of W10-W18 (also labelled A15 through A18). Could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond to what I/O addresses?

Judging from the Wintach tests, I can hardly > imagine that there is a cheat driver for it. I received my Graphite VL on Thursday, and I've had a little bit of  experience with it now.  In general, it feels *FAST*, although this is the first VLB card that I have tried.  Still, the results are  impressive. With my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I've had the following WinTach 1.0 results: Card				WP	CAD	Spread	Paint	Overall ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ATI Graphics Ultra		13.5	14.5	19.1	25.0	18.0 ATI Ultra+ (no aperture)	11.2	13.8	10.7	20.9	14.1 Hercules Graphite VL		16.1	67.8	41.4	52.8	44.5 Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB had an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as fast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests. As an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/- redraw times.  There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly heavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2 seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson's contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex Micrografx Draw document. So far, I'm *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies. The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's.  And I didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...  With Hercules' software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for just $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).

I have a 486/33 VLB machine, with a Wang 96/24 fax/modem. When using the windows terminal application, the only way I can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM2, then go back and change it to COM4.  Then it works fine. (I have it set to COM4 as the port to use)  I don't have anything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manual for all it's worth, but what am I missing?  The modem is  jumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can't use the second serial port and the modem at the same time, but I'm not using the second serial port anyway. Also, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modem and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end answers.  Don't know if that helps any. Thanks,
In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 160's 1 has a 8Mb Simm and the other a 6 Mb simm Both are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed by different people.  Both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the Memory Chimes.  Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer.  In both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback,  my marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are "lopsided" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something?   Anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving. I've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a 2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution. Please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world.

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.   The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event.  At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date. If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it there.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the same.) The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5 public fix 20.

  Well, I've come into some money and want to buy CD-ROM, sound board and speakers.  I have not kept up on any material relating to sound boards and CD-ROM's because until now I never thought I'd have enough money.     So can you guru's out there point me in the direction of a good package including CD-ROM, sound, and speakers (and software I suppose)... OR since I don't REALLY need the CD-ROM right now give me some good ideas for sound boards and speakers.  Those I could REALLY use now.  I have looked at SoundBlaster Pro, which costs about as much as I think I want to spend on a board (~$120), and I've looked at the Gravis Sound board, which is about $140 and I don't know the adv/disadv of either of these boards.     Right now I want to use it with any games that support sound, and to use in Windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there.  So any concise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would be greatly appreciated.  If anyone else is interested in this info I would be glad to summarize responses and post.     And if this is some type of FAQ please point me in the right direction and don't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth.

> >...Why did X designers decide to not associate >the color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the >display it is being drawn on? In X10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests;  that is, the server's drawing model was stateless. This caused problems with performance and network traffic, so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a GC for each color during initialization, then pass the GC id in each drawing request.

I hope that there's somebody out there that can help us. Some of our students change the AMI bios passwords on a few of our computers  and set it for always. What we'd like to know is if there is a way to bypass  or remove the password. We have tried switching bios, but to no avail. The  battery is soldered to the bord, an all three machines is still under  guarentee so if that would have help we can't remove the batteries. Thanks Isak :-) Money can't buy happiness, but surely pays for the illusion.
Yes we have the same problem with xinit.  The problems seems to come from the fact that the XOpenDisplay(":0") fails.   If we try (on our machine named godzilla) setenv DISPLAY godzilla:0.0 Xibm& xterm  It works fine, but the following will not work setenv DISPLAY unix:0.0 Xibm& xterm  Did we set a configuration option incorrectly?

If it is a master, then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present. These must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec- ification.  The CMOS setup is almost positively NOT the problem.  It is probably not the controller - IDE controllers all support exactly two drives maximum.  Check those jumpers. Gordon Lang
Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, I would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course, this would be circumventing the author's wishes on the subject, but I'd say if you're not going to pay him no matter what, you'd be on relatively safe ground with that approach...  In fact, given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices, I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being a lawyer, I can't be positive. Regardless, the fees he's asking are not excessive, and I would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing else. - Brad --  Brad Daniels		`	|  "If money can't buy happiness, I don't work for NeoSoft, and	|		- Weird Al Yenkovic don't speak for my employer.	|

Recently, I have been getting a CMOS Checksum error when I first turn on my computer.  It doesn't happen everytime I turn it on, nor can I predict when it is going to happen.  I have an AMI BIOS and all of the setting are lost, for example the drive types and the password options.  However, the date and time remain correct.  If anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know. Thank you, Mike

greetings.. I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware. My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to configure it as slave drv, but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western Dig, since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted, It just beeped and gave me an error message about HDD controller. So, I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD.   any help on this matter would be much appreciated. (before I trashed my 42MB)   Thankx much

Can anyone tell me the procedure for hooking a Personal Laserwriter NTR serially to a mac?  The documentation says it can be done, but I'm not sure of the correct switch setting to use out of the given non-appletalk switch options.  Also, will I need to install a new driver so that the Chooser knows the printer is hooked up directly (not networked)? Thanks a lot, Ross

However, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the application that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from within an interactive SAS session.  The user site can enter their site-specific "batch profile" into a dataset within our product, specifying the pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options, etc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is written to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and run the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as the job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the interactive session. As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80 characters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in batch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a problem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg. MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single command across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is *STANDARD* with OS/2). The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not within my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT. Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT. And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative script language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption that they have anything other than what comes with NT. I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like "Is vi available for Windows?") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and ***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is it a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I could count on it at all NT sites. One last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities, i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run there.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific commands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment on these commands, I would appreciate it.

>This is the part that usually gets me. While I am set to make money, there usually >are OTHER things to be considered and debated. That is the purpose of life. Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures of success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I think in MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number of people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS. I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to look at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story. I also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call them are highly technical. Look around in the real world people don't want to GREP and AUCK and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their  job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need  a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. Like it or not MS and the multitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows does this and does it WELL. We are running 150 pc's loaded with a complete suite of mostly MS Windows applications in an administrative business function on a Novell network running all software off the server. It does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick Windows again.  Again I repeat to MS keep doing what you are doing. You are doing a great job. Flame on Thx Dave L

I assumed he was referring to OS/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while DOS (and therefore Windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing.

: Hello : I've got an old Trident 8800CS SVGA card, but lacking suitable drivers : for windows 3.1. The drivers for the 8900 series seem to be incompatible. : Does anyone have an idea of where to get these drivers? Address for an : ftp-site would be nice.  : Thanks in advance : Jouni : _______________________________________________________________________________ : Jouni Marttila - Yo-kyl{ 11 B 25,  20540 Turku,  FINLAND - +358 21 374624____ You can find the drivers at wuarchive.wustl.edu in the /msdos/windows3 sub- directory.

Hey All- We have an old (1990) external HD attached to the Plus in our lab.  It had   given us flawless service until last week.  The problem: Someone in our lab   has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an   aftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics "SIMMer").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs   through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin   rectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,   to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the   26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside   down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he   could try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools   that we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,   none of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and   it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain.  Could installing the SCSI   upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board?  The drive seems to spin up   all right and unpark itself upon powerup.  The events are too coincidental to   attribute the problem to stiction. Any help greatly appreciated- James

PhaNG, the Philadelphia Area NEXTSTEP User Group, will be holding a public   sneak preview of NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors.        33rd And Walnut, southeast corner, Philadelphia PA        7 pm to 9 pm 			  			  NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now, only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a "Hot Prospect". Now, NeXT is nearing release of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to the 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily  compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and Motorola hardware. NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression 486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo in San Francisco. The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are   interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by! For a brief summary of what NEXTSTEP offers, see the May 11th issue of  PC Magazine, page 66.

I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through the XView xv_get() function:    x = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_X);    y = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_Y); For example, if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 50,50 the frame comes up in the correct position, with the top left corner (the size handle) at 50,50. xv_get() returns 50,50 as well. But later on xv_get() returns 5,25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame, XV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas, and it turns out (by measuring on the screen) that 5,25 is the position of the first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What gives? Any help most appreciated! Derek P.S. On a related subject, is there any way of querying the window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around frames, etc.? ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

Those >who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm >looking for. I have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or  similar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete, show the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very convenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to be performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the program vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files I use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys. This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager  in several labs in our university.  The drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and the development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the program package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion sched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you can start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19 (to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this windows program start.

I am, at long last, going to replace my beloved 512ke. I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci.  Prices have yet to be worked out, so I'm just thinking right now about their merits and drawbacks. Here's what I've thought of: The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and greater memory capacity. The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci "32-bit clean"?), and would have sound input.  I also like the "pizza-box" case. Performance-wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the LC III being a little slower. So, which should I get? Erik 1

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2 IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and  1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have a Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC  before.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive. However, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other  controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI). just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it. Then, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to  ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you  have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so on.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it. Good Luck! William

I solved my problem.  I still do not understand why it happens ths way; perhaps some of you C++ gurus can explain this to all of us! For some reason when I define the following functins in the class definition (in the .h file) the compiler thinks some pure virtual functions are not defined.  When I placed these two in a separate source file and compiled them, the problem went away.  Any ideas what happen?  Are the functions that are defined in the class construct all inline ?  Is this the problem? virtual int            isEqual (const Object _FAR &obj) const { return this == &(HashEntry&) obj; } virtual void           printOn( Rostream os) const {  os << "[ HWindow is " << (void _FAR *) hWindow << " ]\n";  } -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- - Bowden Wise   Computer Science Dept, Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst, Troy, NY 12180

BEWARE! While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally have those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2 to pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.     If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection can be used. Connect:         GND1    to    GND2 	RxD1    to    TxD2 	TxD1    to    RxD2 Additionally, connect (if software needs it):         RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1 	RTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2 	DTR1    to    DSR1 	DTR2    to    DSR2 You won't need long wires for these!   The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission between two PCs (see software section for details). the PC. This means that for your data set DTR & RTS are incoming signals and DSR & CTS are outputs! .-.-.-.- end .-.-.-  Michael --
Article #61214 (61317 is last): Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more popular than it is?  I would think it would be just as fast, if not  faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz  motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the chip in the future.  I must be missing something, since everyone is  buying the DX2 66...  Many adds don't even mention the DX 50.  Thanks a lot,    -Matt End of File, Press RETURN to quit Yes its realy simple, no one makes a mother board that runs the bus at more than 33MHZ....Sam --  Gosh..I think I just installed a virus..It was called MS DOS6...

We have Suns running SunOS 4.1.3 and Openwindows 3.0 (X11R4). We have used Xvision on a PC, setup to broadcast query to the UNIX xdm servers and allow a user to choose a UNIX client in which to login: xdm will then manage that display. I would like to do the same thing with xfree86 running under Linux, but I don't know how. I don't want to hardwire the UNIX xdm to manage the PC displays as the PC's are not always running Linux  (let alone xfree86). I would like the same setup as provided by Xvision. Can anybody help?

Gateway service has confirmed my suspicion, echoed by a couple of people who responded to the original request for help.  The ATI VLB video board uses the addresses for COM 4.  They could suggest no work around. I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM 4 (even though it could not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse.  This will free up the COM port I need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either the DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know enough about the hardware. Otherwise I must say that the 486DX2/66 system has worked very well - no problems with any other hardware or software. John Siegel

If a win app locks up for some reason,  ctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows.   Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion.

Its my understanding that bus mice are more accurate and "stable" in general than serial mice.

Has anybody every come across a problem whereby a hard disk locks up (ie. crashes the system) when attempting to load disk caching? I think the logic board may have been buggered, but the drive works PERFECTLY without a disk cache. I tried HyperDisk and various versions of SmartDRIVE, all to no avail. Any advice would be MUCH appreciated .. I need a cached drive, but I need the extra space of my second drive just as much! :-) Thanks.

Hello! I have a SE/30 and a Generation Systems 8bit PDS card for a 17" screen. It worked great until I upgraded from 5 to 20 mb ram. Now with Sys7.1 and MODE32 or 32enabler it does not boot.. a tech support person said the card does not support these 32bit fixes. BUT: when pressing the shift key while booting (when the ext. monitor goes black after having been grey) the system  SOMETIMES boots properly!! and then works ok with the 20mb and full graphics. WHAT's HAPPENING??? Thanks a lot for any advice!!! please answer by mail.

I really think you are comparing apples and oranges. Nobody disputes that OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an  individual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that question. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2 and I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work. Go to your local computer store to answer this one. I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. This is where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has won the single user PC war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0. Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II' of the war. Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure  is fun watching and arguing about it tho. Thx Dave L

I think you've got me confused with someone else. I don't  pretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other OSes (including unix & OS/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary features.

Does anyone know how to configure a DOS app in Progman so that only one instance of it can be running at a time? I'd really appreciate some help on how to do this.  I would prefer responses through email if it's not a big  deal, or at least through email _as well as_ posting. Thank you! -- James E.

Print Manager icon, won't it RUN Notepad and Paintbrush before printing?  If you just want to drag a file (.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.   Ted

I am trying to define my own class derived from the Object class so that I may insert them into a HashTable (a class provided by the Container class library). I have defined all of the pure virtual functions of Object, but I still get an error when I attempt to allocate a HashEntry object:   Cannot create instance of abstract class HashEntry Has anyone derived from class Object before?  What have I left out? Here are the virtual functions that I defined from Object: virtual classType      isA()   const { return hashEntryClass; } virtual Pchar          nameOf()const { return "HashEntry"; } virtual hashValueType hashValue() const { return hashValue(hWindow); } virtual int            isEqual (const Object _FAR &obj) const { return this == &(HashEntry&) obj; } virtual void           printOn( Rostream os) const {  os << "[ HWindow is " << (void _FAR *) hWindow << " ]\n";  } -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- - Bowden Wise   Computer Science Dept, Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst, Troy, NY 12180

I've seen this sort  of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT  conflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video  hardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the  Q950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to  24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM -  it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed  then. Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like  QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  This reprograms (some  of) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored. - Dale Adams

I know nothing about Sun's but replacing pieces of libraries, shared or not, is straight forward on RS/6000's (all releases).  Extract the appropriate pierce with ar; rebind the .o; and replace with ar. See Info for details.

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group, I'll take the liberty of responding to some of this.  If you really want Tom to reply A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps ethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on  what you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like "Smoking Clover" would make the link  useless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real world, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes. Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people. >>Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding >>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of >>thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before >>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). > >Hmmm.

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database  remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link. Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent. Let's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server that it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a  solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send it back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw that small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be  repainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits that has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds. In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts  that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls. > > >>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going >>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all >>doing network things also...) >>--  > >What do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other >Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on >the server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how  >good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these  >images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine. X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's  pretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost as good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid. We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a  lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications tell us. +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   | |         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\  | |  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\  | |   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\  | |          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\  | |         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   I am setting up my DOS/UNIX box on a 116M IDE and a 412M SCSI drive and was wondering about the use of the (MS-DOS 5.0) JOIN command.  I like the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C: D: & E: (crap) that DOS enforces.  I like how it would mimic mount points of UNIX filesystems.  I have heard that there were problems with using it, or at least under older versions of DOS.  Please tell! =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= --Steeven M.

   I'm looking for the best source for SIMMs in the USA. I'm not looking for    the lowest prices, but rather for the best quality SIMMs and the one with    the lowest rate of defective SIMMs. I know the chip Merchant has good     prices but they seems to have a high rate of returned SIMMs.    Does anyone know how many SIMMs you have to purchase to obtain quantity    discount ?.

I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because the server on the other machine is using a different colormap. I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay, performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap. Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap but couldn't get that to work either.

We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT.  So far I've drawn the following conclusions: 1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs 2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit 3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one) 4) tcl/tk is a little buggy 5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info) 6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product. 7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money) 8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work 9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ? 10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development. I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products. thanks  --- *	Bruce Trvalik  AOA-----------------* *       (617)864-0201   check your mind at the door - The Band That Time Forgot
	id AA23367; Fri, 23 Apr 93 20:16:02 -0400   Has anybody ever heard of Hawk EISA/VLB motherboards?  NET Computers International (from Computer Shopper) has the 486/33 version w/256k cache for $559.  I'm trying to decide between this motherboard and the NICE motherboard.  Thanks!   PS:  The Hawk motherboard has 3 EISA slots, two of which are VLB.  The spec sounds identical to the Nice.   Tim

I'm planning on getting a StyleWriter II for my Mac SE (2.5 MB ram, HD, two 800k floppy drives).  Do any of you out there have any recommendations as to whether running System 6.0.8 is better or worse than switching to 7.1. I don't do much real work on this machine any more, but would like to keep it for word processing (Using Word 4 and don't see much advantage to going to Word 5, since it is slower).

[as well as showing you that if you don't have a > marketing department to speak of, no one will care how good your system is] I've had the same experience actually. I love the Mac interface and any number of the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost every model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari ST simply "blow the Mac out of the water" in terms of performance. At this time I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the advantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would get their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in muli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((  > I'm still happy with my ci, but I don't understand why the performance is > so bad (comparatively).  They could have done multi-tasking _properly_. > They could have done everthing else better -- but apple didn't. > (of course DOS 6 and windows 3.1 are nothin to write home about either!!) I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does *everything* well someday. If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the speed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms. As for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems almost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a graphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the Quadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc... > Oh well, y'all got $2.00 worth for the price of $0.02 I think mine was only worth $0.01....... ---------------------------------------------------------------------->   "This is not a novel to be tossed away lightly;    it should be thrown with great force."         -Dorothy Parker
hello out in networld,        We have a lab of old macs(SEs and Pluses). We don't have enough money  to buy all new machines, so we are considering buying a few superdrives for  our old macs to allow folks with high density disks to use our equipment.  I was wondering what experiences (good or bad) people have had with this sort of upgrade. murray
Hello, we need the code for decompression of Quicktime JPEG Pict files, as they don't conform to usual jpeg compressors, which are available in source. The code should be in C Pascal or Modula. The code will be used on several platforms to view pictures over ISDN. Perhaps a special hardware will be put around it (much less then a mac! perhaps only a DSP with some support chips) If the code is not available, perhaps the algorithm is available to decompress them.

Hi! I've just installed the new XArchie 2.0.1 and it all works fine, except: on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the program don't work at all, but on the BW terminal it works fine. I can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't give the neat-o change when busy action. (Other programs with similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.) The X-interface author, George Ferguson, suggests it might be a problem with the X intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around to fix it himself. But I know zero about X programming, so I don't think I can find it.  Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem? Andrew --  Dep't of Astronomy and Astrophysics, U. Chicago 5640 S.

   I used to have a lot of line noise problems with my 1200 baud modem. What was sudgested to me was to put a toriod transformer on the line. This is easily done by getting a large toroid core from your local electronics shop, a toroid core is a ceramic/metal "donut", and wind the telephone line in through the center of the core and out around the ouTside five or six times. This is a easy and cheap fix that does not have the hassels of having to use sofware to fix a hardware problem. talk to yah later. mark.

This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers, and users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set of "standard" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports. So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle program that would actually have a problem with this.) -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories
   After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos    and windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple    of different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a    head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  I have,     however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY    do what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows    apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but    OS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  I have heard    that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew    where to obtain a copy.  I would appreciate any information, as I would like,     once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.    ->Robbie<-    z_shererrg.sfasu.edu If you wait until May the 18th you will be able to buy the new OS/2 2.1 since it will be released at Comdex that day. It will run Windows 3.1 apps and Windows enh. mode. If you can't wait, then you can ftp a 6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is probably a lot slower than the final product. When you do your test, please have in mind that a single tasking system will always be faster at doing one task. The real power of OS2 lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch. Happy benchmarking.

>>Just poke out the little pins in the connector, and then replace them in >>the correct slots. > >Is this reverisible?  You can unpoke as easy as you poke? > Yep.  I've done this, too.  The trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push down on the "latch" of each pin and then pull it out of the connector.  Label each one first with tape so you don't get them confused after you've pulled them out.  Compare the pinout tables in the Mitsumi and Soundblaster manuals to get the correct orientation.

    This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I     am getting frustrated and looking for help.     I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a     6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my     applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.     When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many     of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT     2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when     I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under     50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than     my shell running.     I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some     suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.       1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are     some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at     plugging this leak?     2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?     3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with     this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a     great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.     4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was     hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different     than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)     5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less     likely my code will eat resources?     6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for     specifically?     Thanks for your help.  As this is a common problem and I have seen only     a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who     would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending     me email.     danny ===========================================================================
    THe origional bit is missing but long/short follows:     The origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga monitor with a centris (hence title).       The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any old vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two machines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.     NOW, the special interest disclaimer.  The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400 resolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my 1604s). THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.     APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE. personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers doesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits (*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a specialized application video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolution 1168x832 on this $5,  9" "super smelly sock" monitor that will let you display TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably priced "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz vertical.") board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as possible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an inch.                                                                     -A.
I'm running xterm under X11R5, Motif 1.1, mwm and UNIX SVR4 on a UNISYS 386 based machine. My default shell is /bin/csh or the C shell. Whenever I run xterm, I get the following message before the first C shell prompt: After this, I can't run any job control commands like fg, bg etc. Also, I can't run another xterm from the command line of this xterm (I can only launch additional xterms from a .mwmrc menu). I'd appreciate some help with this problem, or pointers to where I can get some help. By the way, my environment variable TERM is set to xterm. ---------------------------- Saad Mufti Personal Library Software

	I've been getting seemingly random disk accesses on my Centris 610 with a Quantum 240 LPS, but this is NOT the regular recalibration it has been doing since I got it....  This is sometimes short, sometimes long, accesses that sound like there is some read/writing going on. 	I have SAM 3.5, and Disinfectant 3.0, but neither picks up anything.. Any ideas? 							Jason.
You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error Checking enabled or disabled.  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error when it's enabled, and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go on the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beep at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring in Cache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms. The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board manufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies (among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some simm sockets to make your board.  I tend to doubt your problem is with your IDE controller, also. Anyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better. mrb

I love my portable system (got a color home setup also. Mac II). Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and other simulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (or overnight) to run, tying up my Mac II. I got the PB100 with fast modem to do light work and on-the-run stuff. I figured I'd give it to my little sister next year when she goes to college. It's running System 7.1 now without any problems. Also I sometimes do DEC4015 terminal emulations with MATLAB on our university's VAX_VMS (nice thing that it benchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac IIfx). So, the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not too hard at all for it). It was a FABULOUS setup !!!!  :)  Weeee!!! (By the Way, all MATLAB software was on class accounts. I was also the TA for a class that used SIMULAB/SIMULINK. We had site-license and take-home, then-destroy later site-release licenses... No pirating there, incase you're wondering.... Great Program!!! ) Just like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never get enuff memory.... Buy it while it's cheap - that is buy it when you get the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading... I ALWAYS run out of disk space... But I have a syquest on the Mac IIsi, so I never worried about space before... Got several carts). -shishin "squish" yamada
>chip in the future.  I must be missing something, since everyone is  >buying the DX2 66...  Many adds don't even mention the DX 50. The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Most of the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively DX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are better off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows the DX2-66 to be generally faster anyway. -- Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software

I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'. There several reasons for this :- When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and the data can be transmitted. When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored somewhere while the disk is writing it out. In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache! May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well... >  > --  >  > TMC >  Guy --  -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Guy Dawson - Hoskyns Group Plc.

While working on my shareware toolbar, I found myself 'eating' resources, and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK, and specifically the debug kernel. Once you have all the SDK stuff installed, (this also comes with VC++), you run 'n2d' which does a 'normal-to-debug' swap. The debug kernel runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower, but you then execute the command DBWIN, and let it report to you what is going on.

I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list.  But we have strayed from the original topic.  Our computer environment is pretty split between Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But there are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users here.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter which AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there is no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been  inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity in a DOS program to selectively transport the files. The question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into windows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is  in a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite clear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies. -- T.J. Fiske

   I have a 386DX clone, with a DTC ESDI controller and Toshiba 660 mbyte drive. Since installing DOS 6.0, when I tried to re-install software from 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks, when I mount the second..third..fourth disks, DOS 6 doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a "DIR", I see the contents of the previous diskette. The only way to get DOS to recognize that diskettes have changed, is to do a "label", and then to not label them.    Buying DOS 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. DOS 5.0 was stable, and worked well with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro, and DESQVIEW/X ( with QEMM,  Manifest, etc), so there aren't any features of DOS 6 that I am using. I guess I should roll back to DOS 5.0 but I am wary of what will happen when I do it.    Besides, like a fool, I don't have a DOS 5. bootable disk anymore. I've made the same mistakes I caution my users not to make. Like sheep, I joined  the crowd flocking to DOS 6. Baaa Baaad system administrator. Phillip Culver Silicon Graphics Inc Mtn. View, CA

Call their Developer Support Services number (sorry, don't have it handy) and ask for the Word for Windows binary file format spec. looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored. General primer: Word for Windows stores its data in two chunks.  The first chunk is the actual text in the file.  This is all stored together and has nothing but text and graphics.  The second chunk is the formatting information. For general use, to read a Word for Windows file, skip the first 384 bytes of the file (its a general header).  Then read the remaining text until you hit binary data. Matt

Subject: *** CONSUMER WARNING ***  MidWest Micro (Ohio) Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully. Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want to trade elsewhere. Despite the fact that they answer the phone, "Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're having a GREAT Day!", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that didn't work as I expected it to. The details: I ordered one of their house brand "Infotel" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems. In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not have ordered it, had I known this in advance. It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time. For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2. Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or 14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested disabling the COM2 port. This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem. I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail  hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I  was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they  didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line. I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number. She promptly switched me to a "Tech Support" rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured. Conclusion: I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more  than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection. For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know  will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have known better...
The most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than the smaller one. If your running the drive on a Mac I would recommend a shareware utility called Timedrive which tests seek, SCSI throughput and rotational speed. This utility should let you know what the differences are between the drives. ***************************************************************************  The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.

RE: Midwest Micro, Article #61200 (61302 is last): I posted almost the same bad experience with  Midwest Micro but our %^*^&*^&* news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. In addition to the facts that: (a) the modems (I had ordered two) wouldn't work as documented and (b) the tech person had NO CLUE as to how it should work, it also turned out that: (c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly USED but the techs thought that was standard practice and (d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and my CMS250 tape drive start running away. That they are incompetent is one thing, but that they sell used stuff as new and won't even apologize for it is another. Stay away from these crooks!

I'm interested in building my own PC. Can anyone recommend a (UK available) book on the subject, and/or sources for parts? Alternatively, can anyone recommend a source for a 486DX (33MHz) PC  (again UK available). I've just seen in Computer Weekly that the March '93 price for these has fallen to sterling 1092 (including os, monitor, keyboard, delivery and VAT), but I can't find a single advert that would give me a system at that price. Many thanks for your help.
There are no MiniDocks with math coprocessors available right now and I am not aware of any in development. Demand appears low for such a device right now, but I'm sure some enterprising vendor would create one if there were sufficient demand. Lynn **** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

I think somebody posted some info about a biobliography program one or  two months ago. I don't rember the detail. What I'd like to have is one  software to organize the literature I'm refereing for scientific  publications.

This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their IIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24 machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present. This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with. Thanks to all who contributed to this poll.  Issues: 	Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without 		add on cards. All reported machines were able to use 		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple 		Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter 		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to 		achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place 	 		At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and 		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported. 		 			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence, 			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at 			higher speeds. 			 	Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was 		repaired and the machine is operational. One other 		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator 		during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user 		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron. 		 		No reports of static discharge damage. 		 		No reports of high speed operation causing damage. 		 		Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of 		defective parachutes. 		 	Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus 		Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with 		success. See case histories 		 	Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed. 		These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some 		used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab 		of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a 		bolt through the hole in the motherboard. 		 		 		 Case Histories:	 All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported CPU versions were 20 mhz. 1)  27.5 mhz operational. Ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing.     No FPU or other add on card     Heatsinked CPU only     On 24 hours/day     No damage during installation     2)  27.5 mhz operational without Apple Nubus adapter. 25 mhz top speed with 	Apple Nubus card installed     Heatsinked CPU only     On 24 hours/day     No floppy problems     No damage during installation     3)  27.5 mhz operational.

What I'd like to see is this scenario:  Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette.  Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information.  They are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes are held in the server.  A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors.  When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALL OTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER.  A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel) into its associated palette.  The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.

You can download it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I don't know what the file is called or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try scanning the index files).

Hi! 	I have a question which is not directly related to X Screen Saver. What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for some time.  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call xlock program. 	Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  Or is there a way to find out how long the server has been idle? Thanks

Special thanks to Brian Evans of Georgia Tech   for all the help.   --> FTP      COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp' from  mishna.esys.cwru.edu (Internet No. 129.22.40.23). A sample ftp session  is given at the end of this file. ********************************************************************** --> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9) 	In this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of  the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.   Since Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working  LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than  Mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK  smaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported  the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the  COSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For  power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very   fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at  the anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On   the  downside, the disadvantage of this update  can be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its  previous version.  ***********************************************************************	 --> For Mathematica 2.0 users 	 	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in   the directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into   the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory.  ************************************************************************** 	     --> Introduction         This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems  analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using  Mathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some   modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package.           This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a  NeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been  used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control  engineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for  undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems  Engineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have  also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and,  IBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested  to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on  platforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to  evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.     Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of   Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the  packages are many notebooks ("COSY_Notes") which demonstrate   the functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of  many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books  listed in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have  been collected from the various references given at the end of this  file. The contents of the notebooks in the "COSY_Notes" directory are  given below.      ----------- Begin "COSY_Notes" Contents -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 01_Introduction.ma  CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Control Systems 	 	Sections:   	     Analyticity 	     Poles and Zeros 	     Signals 	     Forward Laplace Transforms 	     Inverse Laplace Transforms 	     Differential Equation With Zero-Valued Initial Conditions 	     Differential Equation With Initial Conditions 	     	       -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 02_Math_Models.ma  CHAPTER 2: Mathematical Modeling of Dynamic Systems  	 Sections:   	      ODE to State Space   	      Linearization of a Nonlinear System of Equations   	      State Space to Transfer Function 		       -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_*_Transient_Response.ma  CHAPTER 3: Transient-Response Analysis               (Chapter split into three sub notebooks because of file 	     size) 	 NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_1_Transient_Response.ma              	    Sections :        	      Time Response Analysis   	      First order System   	      Second Order System   	      Third Order and Higher Order Systems 	                NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_2_Transient_Response.ma              	    Sections  :        	       	      First Order System (Step Response vs. Time Const)   	       	                NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 03_3_Transient_Response.ma              	    Sections  : 	      Second Order System (Step Response vs. Damping Ratio)   	       	              -----------  NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 04_Steady_State_Response.ma  CHAPTER 4: Steady-State Response            Sections:	       	      Routh's Stability   	      Steady-State Error Analysis                   ----------- 		  NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 05_Root_Locus.ma  CHAPTER 5: Root-Locus Analysis  -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 06_Freq_Response.ma  CHAPTER 6: Frequency-Response Analysis          Sections: 	      Bode Plot Analysis   	      Magnitude vs. Phase Plot (Nichols Plot) 	      Polar Plot   	      Nyquist Plot   	      Combined Example 	        -----------    NOTEBOOK FILE NAME: 07_State_Space.ma  CHAPTER 7: State Space Methods          Sections: 	      Introduction 	      State Transition Matrix 	      Controllability 	      Observability 	      Output Controllability 	      Pole Placement Design  	      Observer Design 	      Time Response Using State Space Methods    ----------- End Notebook Contents -----------   --> Compressed Files         The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9 packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:  COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     		compressed tar file for Unix systems 	  COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh   				systems and encoded by BinHex 4.0  				format (requires the   shareware 				 Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher).

You must use  pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  IBM PC's may limit the  directory name characters to eight. In that event type "pkunzip -o -d  COSY_PAK.zip.  You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any  Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.      Uncompressing and untarring "COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z" or unzipping  "COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip" will create a directory called "COSY_PAK".          	 Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory  "COSY_PAK" containing the following three files, four  sub-directories and their contents: SUB-DIRECTORIES in "COSY_PAK":     COSYPAK    - contains control tool box packages    MANUAL     - COSY_PAK manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats.

To use the notebooks, move the directory `COSYPAK' to   a  directory that  Mathematica can recognize : 	         /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine,         MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on an Apple Macintosh,         c:\winmath\packages                  	on an IBM PC. 	At the beginning of the "Initialization" cell of each notebook  in  "COSY_Notes" directory, we list the example about how to make  Mathematica identify the directory: 	(* Initialization of Path *) 	(* Example For a UNIX machine  (Default) *)  	(* 	$Path=Join[$Path, 	{"/LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages"}]; 	*) 	 	(* Example For an Apple Macintosh  *)  	(* 	$Path=Join[$Path, 	{"MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages"}]; 	*) 	 	(* Example For IBM PC 	 	 *) 	(* 	$Path=Join[$Path,	 	 {"c:\winmath\packages"}];	 	*)	 Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the  Mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$Path'  setting. 	This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory         /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine         MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on a Apple Macintosh         c:\winmath\packages                	on an IBM PC --> Mathematica 2.0 users 	 	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  the directory For_2.0. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0  into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory.  --> Getting started        After installation, start Mathematica and open the notebooks in  the "COSY_Notes" directory. All notebooks load their own packages.  Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. IBM users however will have to  evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.      ***************************************************************  --> USER RESPONSIBILITIES       We request you to take a few minutes and fill out the  information below and mail it to us by e-mail / FAX / U.S. Mail.

According to what I saw in a store today, the Performa 405 is not the same as an LCIII.  It only has a 16Mhz 68030 while the LCIII has a 25Mhz 030. Correct me if I am wrong, because it is possible that the dealer may have forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer. Dealers who sell the Performa are known to have about as much knowledge about Macs as I do about DOS machines. Saurabh.
*** On 04-21-93  04:30, Michael Shapiro had the unmitigated gall to say this:  MS> The DOS system date has a twenty-four hour clock and a rollover bit.  MS> When the system crosses midnight, the rollover bit is turned on.    MS> Subsequent reads of the time add one.  There's no change possible  MS> (This information was current up through DOS 3.3.

If a program sets the DOS clock via DOS system services, then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value. This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that errors in the DOS clock did not bleed over into the BIOS clock.

Hi, I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events, so that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in  some sort of 'preferences' file. I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell:  XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData); This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager (mwm). However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure structure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y). The width and height memebers are correct. When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings. Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero? Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes? I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values for the x, y, width, height resources.

I can produce similar artifacts. I am using a Centris 610 with an Apple 16" monitor.  I got the 8/230/CD configuration, so there is on-board ethernet and 1 Megabyte of video ram. The effect only occurs in 256 color and 256 grey modes.  Any vertical scrolling operation, whether with a scrollbar or, say, using vi and inserting lines, will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen. They do not persist -- each is visible for perhaps one refresh, and then that part of the screen is back as usual. They seem to always start at or about the 64th pixel from the left, and are maybe 512 pixels wide.  This is certainly not preventing me from using my Macintosh ;-), but it does seem to be a sign of something perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry... I went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center, at:   1-800-776-2333, or 1-800-767-2775 (more direct?) The person who answered was polite :-).  I also took the chance to complain about my mouse button sticking, and about the mac hanging on boot after a (hard - killed MacsBug) crash which left a CD in the drive.

The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a (stuff deleted) My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me. I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip. It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case, so the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go. All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable. There are other "board" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment. The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit. PC-Connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day delivery.  The Y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the power supply.  PCP&C make the best power supplies available IMHO. -- Channel 1 (R)   Cambridge, MA
Due to the large amount of request for 3dbench of ET4000/W32, I finally can get a 3dbench v1.0 from a ftp site. The 3dbench of ET4000/W32 in my Cardex W32 card with 1MB DRAM has superscape benchmark of 26.3 frames/sec. Hope it will satisfy people curiosity of this ET4000/W32 performance.

Hi, 	I've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988 keyboard controller, and uses memory interleaving rather than caching). It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause the machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386 enhanced mode.  This occurs in Norton Desktop, File Manager, and when trying to install software.  Running Win 3.1 in standard mode works fine. 	Has anyone run into this?  Any ideas?  Much thanks appreciated. David

The problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as the analog sweep board) is on its way out. Apart from a board swap (bikkies to Apple), there's not much the average Joe can do to fix it. You can, of course, try and re-adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should be as close to 5v as you cn get it) but this is more often than not a temporary fix.

I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic. We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4. --  Regards, Martin    /\/\     :  Martin Visser - Electrical / Software Engineer    / / /\    :  Engineering Technology Department  / / /  \   :  BHP Steel - Slab and Plate Products Division / / / /\ \  :  P.O.

I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux system. - It must be free. - It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600)   No motif/openlook etc. - It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software   works ok. - It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents   with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one   of the supported formats to ps. - It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable). I know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I have no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are. - ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows. - support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects. - support for texts in any size. - ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing. - ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component   (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle) - any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing. - less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection.   If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the   rest of the drawing, stay connected. Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it.  I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my whishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs with respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs known to work on Linux with monochrome X? Lennart.

Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4. EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.   So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does not.   --  "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>	I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost) >to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would >reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than >some amount of time. I believe that Apple, Sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate power-saving techniques;  this is also something that governments in other countries are likely to require in the future, so expect to see it.  This may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on automatically.  (Is this a "sell" on screen saver software companies?) Goals for "idle" power consumption have been set at something like 30 watts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on this). Note that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial, especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems. Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for the night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per year.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would probably have greater than double that value. Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and home computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...), building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to cut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard. BTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front.  There was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling.  This may only apply to the monitors we use, but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back.

  A friend is heavily into MIDI and is using a Quadra 900 (maybe 950) with  all but one NuBus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video card.  He reports 8 bit video is too slow for good real-time display of what he needs to see.  He also reports that the built-in video is even worse.  He's not a Mac guru, and I haven't seen the system, so this is about all I know. I suspect that his NuBus is heavily loaded, and think improvements might come from a switch to an accelerated PDS slot video card.  Does this sound right?  Who makes a PDS accelerated video card for the Quadra thats worth looking at?  Any other suggestions?  Thanks in advance! -- snail:  The MITRE Corporation, 1120 NASA Road One, Houston, Texas 77058
We are planning on buying 15-20 X Terminals.  I have the article from Jim Morton regarding prices, etc., and am looking for any other information that will help me decide which to buy. The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM, running OSF/1.  From what I have found out so far, it would be best to run as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11, window manager, xterm, etc.), and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal (where n ranges from 4 to 10, depending on who I talk to).

You gave the impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are correct re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it, you can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the uncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.  In fact, with Win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default to stacking your A,B and D drives.   Roger

True, there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but the internal power supply is well-protected. (I've turned my Mac on and off  six or seven times a day for three years without problem).  The monitor is the same.  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity -- twice as much as a television, possibly more. Turn it off when you're not using it.  It'll save you money and the world a few more resources. -Kelley- --  ----------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------                   I buy and pay for my own opinions

Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC. You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've studied it. The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship to reality.

> What's the difference between a 16550 UART and a 16550A UART? Thanks! The difference is that the 16550 got bugs while the 16550A can be used whithout problems even in fast serial communications.

FOR SALE: AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax, v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone line.  They will "fall back" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems. It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc). They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible. These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T. They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so, as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts). I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is backed by a company that will never go away. This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.) If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice. If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at  (800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them. The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week. Thanks.   Pete

IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its (IDE bus) signal timing doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing.

I don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here's my question: CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the          university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my          account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it          for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone          number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that          I type "telnet uicvm" or "tn3270 uicvm" (either will work) at the DOS          prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then          dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon          screen. "TELNET" and "TN3270" are the names of batch files in my SLIP          directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the          session. PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I          hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I          talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that          I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me          instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to          modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)          to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP          from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP          would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-          cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when          that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often          took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center          does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to          them with more questions. QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows          and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too          expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that          there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost          hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:          1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1          2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation          3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the             mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp             transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about             that.          A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true          Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under          Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently          with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet          session and other applications.

I have a Sony 1304s whch I would like to hook up so that I get its  power though my Quadra 800's power supply. ie, if I had an apple monitor, I could plug the monitor directly into the computer so that when I hit the power button the keyboard, both the monitor and computer go on, and when I shut down, both go off.  Is there an extension cord type cable I can buy which allows me to plug my existing power cord into and then plug this "extension cable" into my Quadra? Any thoughts and comments would be appreciated, Thanks in advance, Derek ****************************************************************************** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bldg 54-1511A                          * Clark Laboratory 317 Massachusetts Institute of Technology  * Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Cambridge, MA 02139                    * Woods Hole, MA 02543 (617) 253-2922                         * (508) 457-2000 x2814 *******************************************************************************

In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently, it supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However, it allows arbitrary scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing. Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told that it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with both color and monochrome X. --  Bill Cheng // UCLA Computer Science Department // (310) 645-8328 3564-C Boelter Hall // Los Angeles, California 90024 // USA
There has been a long running discussion over changing the Startup logo for Windows for a few weeks here. While all the COPY methods are great & haven't seen any mention of a program that will do it for you.....  Well... I found one on CICA called winlogo (Can't remember where unfortuantely), and it seems to work real well... even comes with a couple example .RLE files.  What I'd really like though is a way to create .RLE files myself, specifically the RLE4 format mentioned in the winlogo readme file. Can anyone point me in the direction of such a beast with a REAL directory path ?? All the ones I've seen mentioned didn't pan out..... --  |Disclaimer > Any "end-user" software that provides NO avenue for user | |of the week> modification or programmability is NOT user friendly.    |
Subject: ******* Cool Demo Now Available on Internet! ********* Bristol Technology announces the availability of  its HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading. This demo showcases the two products in the form of a  diagram editor called DE. Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself: 	 o Complete on-line context sensitive help system. 	 o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript. 	 o Rotated Text support! 	 o Source code for the demo is provided. The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9). There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory: Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x) HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9) If you have any questions about the demo, send an If you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...)  Remember to use binary mode! What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on...... --------------------------------------------------------- Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter. 			    HyperHelp 3.0 			    ------------- HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one line function call, application developers can access the full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF, project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility. This allows a documentation department to maintain a single set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker.  And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler! New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History window. 			     Xprinter 2.0 			     ------------ Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated printer support to their existing/new X based applications very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for our demo and see Xprinter in action. If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology for UNIX SVR4.2. Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about HyperHelp and Xprinter.  If you have any questions or comments, send them to us at: 				Happy demoing, 					The staff at Bristol Technology

So, use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it in SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!). And the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets, setting the visual and colormap resources rather than direct X routines, so I could be wrong. But, I think this is the general difficulty.

| I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday, and installed it into my Gateway | DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5 What is PAS16? Any articles (or reviews) describing it? --
: Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember : those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drives : are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb : disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the : prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently : not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to : develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there : any substantial interest in developing the flopticals? Certainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a cheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP 200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark. A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy drive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy. On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was quoted as saying that a 2.5" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being productized. The article said that one of the problems holding back development in this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2 distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead to get MDs accepted. -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------                 inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq 		"They didn't like the rates, they don't like the poll tax, 		 and they won't like the council tax."   - Nicholas Ridley

I have a Gateway 2K 486DX/33 system with the ATI Ultrapro video card (identical to the system mentioned in the original posting, except 33MHz instead of 66).  For some reason, the system refuses to recognize COM4.

I'm using Norton Cache 5.0, which is really nice but horrible incompatible. Some games won't work it, my streamer software won't work with it and Windows doesn't like it at all. But when copying or deleting lots of small files, only NCACHE is really fast. You see, to write a file the FAT must be changed. But to write 1000 files the FAT must be changed only once. Is there any cache program out there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my applications? Any help is really appreciated.

I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about this problem........ - I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded   text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.   The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting   truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables   LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,   the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything   works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.   (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual    application, just in my sample code to make things easier) 	 - I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up   to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do      XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources   are set to japanese fonts. - Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially   created with UIL.  The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!) I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the source to look at it is just a guess. Please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion, or if you want the sample program. THANKS!!!!!!!! - Susan    617-873-8190
>We are using pkzip V2.04 and I am interested to hear from >people who have used one of the many Windows programs that >call these. >Which ones are available and does any one stand out amongst >the rest? > Well, I got  WINZIP from cica (don't know which version, but I think it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and I was initially imressed. But here's the low-down: WINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  It lets you vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a /checkout directory, and creates a "checkout" .grp and group if you want to check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these on exit, if you didn;t like the program. *HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don't konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I "zip" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something or other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know (as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do, now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the "run" cmd) but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip file, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only. I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir. Still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful "unzip"ing functions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the new ver.  (as for now, a good old, "run-->unzip *.zip" will work. (PS> if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know). peace, Mickey --  ace|| ||                                   ...!uunet!seas.gwu.edu!louray |||| \/|  *how do make a ms-windows .grp file reflect a HD directory??* \\\\   |  "well I ain't always right, but I've never been wrong.."(gd)

From what I've seen in coursework, most CPUs never actually "idle".  They will continue to service interrupts, etc., etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's doing. I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions, but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be negligible.

	of Denver for the Denver community.  The University has neither 	control over nor responsibility for the opinions of users. I have some questions about this subject.  I like to leave my computer on if I think I'm going to be using it withing the next 2 or 3 hours, but I get sick of my Dad constantly coming up to me and asking "Why is the computer on if you're not using it?"  I also wonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from other things (garbage disposal, etc.)  Here are my questions:   How much harm do voltage fluctuations cause?  My computer does not share a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a refrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on (whose doesn't?), and also when the washing machine does anything.  All these things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer, right?  I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at different speeds.  Is it safer to turn it off and back on when I want to use it or to leave it on?   How much electricity does my computer use?  I have an Apple IIgs (ne flames), with a Kensington System saver GS (1 electric fan inside), an AppleColor RGB monitor, and an EXTERNAL 3.5" HD (1 fan and its own P/S).  How do I translate this into Kilowatt-Hours?  Also, how much of this is used by the monitor?   Does the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is totally black but still on?   Many computers spin the HD up and down constantly to save power.  I always thought this was harmful to the HD and defeats the purpose of leaving the computer on in the first place (except portables).  Is this true?   Thanks for the Info.  I think this will help lots of people.   Stacy

Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and can point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is: Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the data  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow link), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the picture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be painted. Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted as  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a small  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the magnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X server  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to ask that a "filter" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process ("Permission denied" ;-), and have it open a local window? It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up such  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each one by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand. But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice to hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I obviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all, we might want to get a copy. Oh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build demos  that  can  show such things as "If this were run across, say, a 4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear."  Then  the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for. --  If the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would  now cost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would explode, killing all its passengers.
  I'm running HP-UX 8.07 with HP VUE 2.01 and I need a hardcopy of   the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to    include in a manual.

Xwd seems to wait for the window server, but the window   server doesn't answer.    Any suggestions? I must use xwd because I don't have access to   ftp and I can't obtain another program to grab the screen.

The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple  and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an "idle" temp - not doing lots of bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This is in a Micron computer, without heatsink.

I recently bought a PLI 21mgbyte floptical drive, and I was very happy  with it until I tried to use it to format a 1.4 HD diskette. I put the HD floppy in my Superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it correctly, and now my Superdrive refuses to recognize ANY floppy (it says "this disk is unreadable" and asks if I want to format it) even original systems floppies from Apple. Nor will it format the disks if I try to ("initialization failed!")  Strangely enough the floptical still reads both the 21 MB and 1.4 HD disks, but I cant look at my 800k floppies, and if I have a crash I'm screwed because the Floptical can't be used as a start-up disk.  PLI has been unresponsive.  Any ideas? Has this happened to anyone before? I was looking for an inexpensive storage solution, and now I am looking at an expensive repair.

As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by  shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This  will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS  settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386,  there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of  shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts  power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is  something like this on your board too.  In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on  "Setup" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to " Always" unless they know what password you used.

This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking: I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0, which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen. My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions: static Bool next_savescreen(scr,on) ScreenPtr scr; Bool on; {   /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */   if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { 		nextSetLastEventTime();   }   if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */ 		next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle); 		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */   }   else {											 /* Unblank the screen */ 		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);   }   return TRUE; } I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver, but I cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the screen. Any tips/help would be appreciated. Thanks. --  Douglas Scott                              (805)893-8352 Center for Computer Music Research and Composition University of California, Santa Barbara

Could someone give me some info on Soft PC.   How does it work? What kind of performance can I expect? Can you run windows under it adequately? Any info if appreciated.
 A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine c't about a so-called Videostreamer. This is an interface between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?) claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape.                          ^^^^^^^^^^ It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200, I think) My question is:  Does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes   REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite  unbelievable to me).  However, any comments on the interface are appreciated. Please mail your replies directly to me, I will sum up if neccesary. Thanks in advance... -Gerhard

I have heard of crashing problems with PDS-based FPUs on the LCIII. Asante may have fixed them but why bother. Why bother building an LCIII card with an FPU anyway? The extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. I say FPU on main logic board, in socket, Ethernet alone on PDS card, in slot. Mark
Can anybody tell me anything about the availibility of non-Roman fonts for X-Windows? Especially Unicode and/or han idiographic fonts. Also, how about conversion tools for getting PC/Macintosh fonts into a format suitable for X? I would assume it is not too difficult for bitmap fonts.

I have a new monitor which I set up approximately 3-4 feet from  where the AC power enters my house - at my fuse box.  Is this safe for the monitor, or will/can the EMF emitted by the AC current eventually affect my monitor?  If so, how, and is the  damage permanent or would degaussing fix it? Thanks, Tom Catalino
By night I'm an Amiga user. By day I work with windows. I'd be much more  comfortable in windows if I had Two things. 1. A good Personal information manager. You know- a calendar, address book, reminder list etc... rolled into one clean interface. 2. A good file manager. Microsofts is very poor by my standards. How about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations  between them. being able to launch programs from the same interface would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing. Those who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm looking for. If anyone can steer me towards an FTP sight with these programs it would make my transition to windows a lot easier.

I recently made the mistake of purchasing a SONY CPD-1320 monitor for my Mac IIci.  The monitor is very good, however it seems that the IIci does not support VGA (then why did you buy it you ask?  I am stupid I reply).  What I am looking for is a video card, preferably 8 bit, which supports VGA.  I am interested in any information I can get.  Offers for the sale of applicable cards will also be considered.   Thanks in advance. Jim Pyke
>It's called the free enterprize system. I suggests that those who wish to >enhance DOS, do it, an sell it, or give it away. Microsoft can't be  >everything to everyone! period! It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing budgets that MS do.  4DOS, for instance, is everything that COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS).  Those who use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  But they have to rely on word of mouth for sales.  It seems to have worked pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine.  That's okay, marketing isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way.  They have a lot more to be proud of than MS does.  If MS really gave a damn, they could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with compatability issues and absconding with the technology. DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch marketing and vendor agreements.  The "mediocre" was excusable in the early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years to play with it. An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least have the names buried in the files.  Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0 and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it? --  There's at least one fool in every married couple.

At the moment, I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3 and OpenWindows 2.0. This configuration is slow and I can't run all the programs on OW2. For example, when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2 display, I can't open the compose window. I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes, we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start the X programs. Is there a "ready to go" binairy of the X11 server for my configuration (I have read something about Xsun), or must I compile the X11 stuff by myself? Any help is welcome 	V.

One of our users is having an unusual problem.  If she does an Alt/Tab to a full-screen DOS program, when she goes back to Windows her desktop fonts have changed.  If she goes back to a full-screen DOS program and then goes back to Windows, the font has changed back to its default font.  It's not a major problem (everything works and the font is legible), but it is annoying.  Does anyone have any idea why this happens.  By the way, she has a DEC 486D2LP machine.     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ State University of New York 1400 Washington Ave. Albany, NY 12222 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something. Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment. I am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, VUE and X11R4 using Xt anbd Xaw. What I did until now: I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize. I passed as a application_class name 'commandWidgetClass'. Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues. When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it. Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ? In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ?

REPOST - DUE TO NET PROBLEMS Hi,    I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM revision 376. I had reports that this Mac was having trouble  formatting disks and by the time I got to it, the FDHD just would not respond although all other functions were fine. I checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin 6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. The power  supply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair. With the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error: With the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completion of boot cycle an alert displays "The disk is unreadable - do you want to eject it?". For every combination of response, the alert  reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The FDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable of ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether there is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external  connector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V. With the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great  (MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now shows no voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V. Now, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K external drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when connected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16 (after suitable surgery to the external drive). The voltages at J16  (with the internal FDHD disconnected) are as follows: 	PIN	Volts	PIN	Volts 	1	-	2	5 	3	-	4	5 	5	-	6	5 	7	-	8	- 	9	-	10	5 	11	-	12	- 	13	10.75	14	5 	15	10.75	16	5 	17	10.75	18	- 	19	10.75	20	5 This machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG tests. I have tested all diodes and pica fuses and can find no problems. Does anybody have any ideas ?                         Best wishes,                           Woody.

Hello Netters 	I recenlty aquired enough money to purchase a laser printer. The other day, I bought the COMPUTER SHOPPER mag.  I was looking through printer review section and noticed the WINPRINTER800.

The controller may come with software to update its on-board BIOS, or may be designed to work with a particular drive.  Seagate drives usually have special controllers for use on XT's, and these are tailored to the drive. Also, you cannot low-level format an IDE drive.  The low-level format is stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called "servos" (not like the electronic use of the term) that need a higher recording bias than the drive's recording heads can generate.

Call Dell tech support (or better, post to them on CSERVE if you have an account) and get the memory range(s) used by video RAM on your machine. The block windows from using those ranges with an EMMEXCLUDE= statement in the 386Enh section of SYSTEM.INI. You probably should include a statement excluding the same range from EMM386 or whatever memory manager you use in CONFIG.SYS. Dell "installs" Windows on the machines they ship, but the installation doesn't consist of much more than  copying the files to a hard disk. You still have to do the work. And the fact that you have the problem in Enhanced mode but not standard strongly suggests a high memory conflict.
I've found that I have to add the "-8" option for displaying JPEGs with the new version.  For some reason, if I don't, it goes into 24-bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors  (from a 6x6x6 array) instead of 256 and looks grainier.  Since I'm on the ubiquitous 8-bit pseudo color display I would have thought it could tell that. --  This is news.  This is your       |    Peter Scott, NASA/JPL/Caltech
Is it possible to rip an external SyQuest removable drive out of its external casing and install it into the 5 1/4" empty bay slot on a Centris 650? I know a special bracket would need to be purchased, but is there any power hookup/SCSI constraints that would prevent it? If anyone has done it, could they mail me some instructions. It doesn't seem to be that overwhelming an undertaking. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |   nicholas lamendola                |  "...he who controls the fork,        | |                                     |   controls the meal of his choice..." | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I have an application which draws graphs, bar charts etc. I need to include print support for these from within my application i.e. a user can print the graphs from within the applictaion by clicking on a print button. I am  not sure if I can invoke xwd & xpr from within my application and specify the window id to get my window dump and then send this file for printing or  if there are other ways of doing this. I would appreciate any help in this  regard. Thanx. 	- Mahendra. PS : Please mail your replies to me as I am not a regular reader of this  news group.

Hi Netters. For my home computer I have a humble MacLC with a 12" color monitor. The majority of my work is writing, therefore I would love to have a b&w portrait monotor conected to the LC.  However, I sometimes do need the color monitor. My question is this; Is there a good (Cheap) way to hook up two monitors to my LC and is there anyone out there that has done this, how do you like it? Please respond here or to me directly. Thanks for your time, hope to talk to anyone soon! jerry salem
I saw an ad for this and it basically is an advanced print manager... it lets you monitor your printing more closely and comes with a bunch of True type fonts... anyone have this? Good? Bad? Worth it?

              at Oracle Corporation.  The opinions expressed are those               of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle. I have a Leading edge 486sx25 with 4 Megs of RAM that are in the forms of   4 1 meg SIMMS.  Each SIMM has *two* chips on it. They are manufactured by   Samsung and are 80ns.  A salesman told me that the leading edge CPC-2300   motherboard has the extra parity bit built in and reccomemnded I use MAC   SIMMS. I tried using 4 Megs pulled out of a Mac SI (these are 8 chip   SIMMS), but I got too many windows protection faults and parity errors. I   guess I should use the same SIMMS as the ones I have, but I can't find   any!! Most of the places I have called carry only 3 8 or 9 chip SIMMS. So if anybody knows where I can get memory that is good with my computer   or if you have any suggestions at all, please let me know. Any help is truly appreciated. -Eric

If anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know. Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery  maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and  the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try  replacing the battery. If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a  more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor  charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though. It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is  corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and check out your system.

A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card.  A pretty nice board.  Fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the SVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion.  At the time I was just buying a VLB system, so after checking out the card I sent it back.  I wanted a VLB card, and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card.  This card is fairly fast, will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS (the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight answer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17" Magnavox, which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match. But... That is for my wife.  I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself, and am looking for a graphics card to drive it.  I want > 70Hz refresh, and would really like it to handle my CD-Roms.  I tried the Orchid P9000, which did neither of those things (though Robert at Wietek did say that the >70Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base).  So my thoughts go back to Hercules.  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the Graphite around the end of March.  I have heard precisely ZERO about it since then.  Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities (and price) it has? Any info would be most appreciated. Geoff Sherwood

We just received an AppleOne Color Scanner for our lab.  However, I am having trouble getting reasonable scanned output when printing  a scanned photo on a LaserWriter IIg. I have tried scanning at a  higher resolution and the display on the screen appears very nice.   However, the printed version is coming out ugly!   Is this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer?  Or are  there tricks involved to get better quality?   Or should we be  getting something (like PhotoShop) to "pretty up" the image? I will appreciate any suggestions. Thanks in advance, -Kris  --------------------------------------- | Kris Schroeder | AI/KBS Lab, Michigan State University

I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I subscribe to an "outernet" system which allows me to dial up via modem and download e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so.  Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP.  Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I didn't want in the first place. If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other ways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives rather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size. Thanks Ed Klein
I have also moved on to a 66.6 mhz clock. Thus far not problems. I'm not totallysurprised as I've had Q700 run at 35.4 mhz (CPU clock speed) using a VSO. My 25 mhz rated Daystar QuadraCache got very hot at 32 mhz and would fail previously. I glued on a piece of aluminum stock to the hi speed RAM chips and it runs cool without problems at 33.3 mhz. The combination is faster than a Q950.
>    I am setting up my DOS/UNIX box on a 116M IDE and a 412M SCSI drive > and was wondering about the use of the (MS-DOS 5.0) JOIN command.

I have heard that there were problems > with using it, or at least under older versions of DOS.  Please tell! I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good success in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command (a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:   "JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if   you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for   Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives   from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use   JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1." Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems that have been "mounted" using join. In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file. Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the joined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original *.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you search your disk systems, the document is gone. I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box when JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an "ls" on the c:\temp dir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to  reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw DOS. So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like. Wouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately, JOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source. It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was meant for casual, even ignorant users, so "mounting" all the drives in one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant  users -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(. -- Aspen Technology Group               UUCP:   {uunet}!csn!atglab!jls PO Box 673, Ft.

My Windows 3.1 installation has somehow gone awry.  Whenever I try to run Windows now, the logo comes up OK, but when it tries to enter Windows itself, the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong graphics mode or something.  It's completely illegible although functional as I can still exit to DOS with an ALT-E RETURN combination. I tried to reinstall Windows again, but if you recall, halfway through the installation process, install takes you into Windows and there my graphics problem surfaces again so I cannot complete the re-installation. All this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my config.sys and autoexec.bat have been restored to what they were before this problem cropped up. I'm running a 486-33DX with a Diamond Stealth VRAM (I've resinstalled the Stealth video drivers again but with no luck).  I'm also using QEMM and Stacker 3.0 but Windows is installed on an un-stacked partition.  And of course, it worked perfectly before. Any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks. -Hutch-
I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426  chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu  (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so. From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons  (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the  following for the sake of comparison: 							Wintach              		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65 Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of  the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review. Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the  DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120  drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s,  I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at  least that was what the program said. Oliver Weatherbee

The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop machine by 5-10% (and the rest of the powerboks). I think the explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5 cycles I believe).  Things that could affect performance would be factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU (which the Duo doesn't have undocked).  Extensions and background applications can slow your computer down too.  Real life differences in speed are likely to be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen depth you are running etc. Espen PS!  The Duo is 32-bit through-out.

You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get to the root window.  Now, this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window, so be sure to take that into account for further calculations. Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using XGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION. Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the windows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly. All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the window-manager is using. Now, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate  where you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly). DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.  But I did get it working under several window managers correctly.  Feel free to call or e-mail for further info.               -McGary --  Mike D. McGary                VOICE: (214) 620-2100 Intellection                  FAX:   (214) 484-8110

Hi All, I've heard of a commercial package named ZINK, that could convert MS-Windows source-code to XWindows source-code (C). The only problem is, the package isn't available in Holland (at least, I can't find it anywhere :-( ) Is there another package (preferrably free- or shareware), that can do the  same thing? And if so, where can I find or buy it? Thanks in advance Arjen

Variables are defined are as follows:     int                 i, j, k, lut_index     color_type          min_image, max_image;     color_type          image Pixel_Value_Range, last_image, start, end, jump,                         lut [ 512 ];     unsigned long       pixel;     double              red, green, blue; /*  * Data structure used by color operations  * typedef struct {         unsigned long pixel;         unsigned short red, green, blue;         char flags;  /-* do_red, do_green, do_blue *-/         char pad; } XColor; ***************/     XColor              rgbcolor, hardwarecolor; With color_type defined as { double red, double green, double blue }. What I need to know is how to set [is it possible] the values in hardwarecolor to work within the call to XAllocColor:     start.red = (int) 255 * min_image.red;	/* 0..255 */     end.red   = (int) 255 * max_image.red;	/* 0..255 */     jump.red  = (int) (( end.red - start.red ) / 7);     start.green = (int) 255 * min_image.green;  /* 0..255 */     end.green   = (int) 255 * max_image.green;  /* 0..255 */     jump.green  = (int) (( end.green - start.green ) / 7);     start.blue = (int) 255 * min_image.blue;    /* 0..255 */     end.blue   = (int) 255 * max_image.blue;    /* 0..255 */     jump.blue  = (int) (( end.blue - start.blue ) / 7);     lut_index = 0;     for (i=0; i<8; i++)         for (j=0; j<8; j++)             for (k=0; k<8; k++)                 {                 if ( i == 0 || jump.red < 1 )                     lut [ lut_index ].red = start.red;                 else                     lut [ lut_index ].red = jump.red * i - 1;                 if ( j == 0 || jump.green < 1 )                     lut [ lut_index ].green = start.green;                 else                     lut [ lut_index ].green = jump.green * j - 1;                 if ( k == 0 || jump.blue < 1 )                     lut [ lut_index ].blue = start.blue;                 else                     lut [ lut_index ].blue = jump.blue* k - 1;                 hardwarecolor.red   = (short) lut [ lut_index ].red;                 hardwarecolor.green = (short) lut [ lut_index ].green;                 hardwarecolor.blue  = (short) lut [ lut_index ].blue;                 hardwarecolor.pixel = lut_index; printf("HW1: i = %d :  %d %d %d: pixel = %d \n", lut_index, hardwarecolor.red,                 hardwarecolor.green, hardwarecolor.blue, hardwarecolor.pixel );                 status = XAllocColor ( dpy, colormap, &hardwarecolor ); printf("HW2: i = %d: %d %d %d: pixel = %d \n", lut_index, hardwarecolor.red,                 hardwarecolor.green, hardwarecolor.blue, hardwarecolor.pixel );                 if ( status != 0 )                     {                     XSetForeground ( dpy, gc, hardwarecolor.pixel );                     XFillRectangle ( dpy, win, gc, 1, 1, MAXCOLUMN, MAXROW );                     XFlush ( dpy );                     sleep (10);                 printf("%d: %f %f %f at %d \n", lut_index, lut [ lut_index ].re                             lut [ lut_index ].green, lut [ lut_index ].blue,                             hardwarecolor.pixel );                     }                 lut_index = lut_index + 1;                 } Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me with this problem.

I have an 8-bit serial card with two ports.  Each port has the option of using IRQ 2,3,4 or 5.  I also have two serial ports on a multi-I/O card, and the ports can be set to IRQ 3,4,5,7 or 9.  From other posts I've read, I get the impression that IRQ2 on the 8-bit card is the same as IRQ9 on the multi-I/O card.

==== BEGIN REPOST ==== IBM, Apple, Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week, as Motorola Corp., IBM, and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s Pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two configurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50 SPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89 performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000 workstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus built in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the Micro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures, including ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source noted. According to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one source said. ==== END REPOST ====

Very well indeed.  At home (a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro) I can stretch an AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly.  It drops a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean one frame update every 30 seconds.  An ISA Graphics+ was able to do "Zoom by 2" without any perceptible performance penalty.  It is the best performance I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board (which uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA bus at any point). John Munsch
I've written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+, under OpenWindows 3.0. The application uses XView stuff to create my window, and the SUN XGL graphics library for rendering into the Canvas. The application does real-time 2-D animation, but it does not update the the display fast enough. I'm using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my update routine, and it's not happening fast enough. I want it to update 25 times / second. It's only doing about 11. Also, it appears to be compute bound, because if I run anything else while my appplication is up, the update rate slows down even more. Any ideas ? Thanks.

I would like to know as well, since I just bought a 200MB Seagate IDE drive and want to add it to my computer (a four-year-old Gateway 386/20), which currently has an 80MB Seagate SCSI drive.  The SCSI controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS setup, i.e. both hard drive settings are listed as "Not installed," and apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders.  I wondering if this is a problem.  Also, I remember how, when I helped my cousin install his second IDE drive, we had to define a master/slave relationship for them; do I need to do something similar here? >I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the _boot_ drive.

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr. it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly 4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed. I havent used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice. 						dieter --  Maehlsweg 32 ,D-2300 Kiel 17, Germany                         Master of the WOM Tel   .: +49 431 362705 (Voice) FAX\BOX: +49 431 361437 ZyXEL-V.fast-Waffle/FAX		 compuserve  100060,654

Hello,    I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card (the older version with the DIP switches on the back).  I have two problems: 1 ) I've lost the manual!!! 2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and     everything works fine until I run windows, when     the network connection dies.     (In case it's important, the network card is an      SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O      address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is      D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)     I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't know the Bboard number.     If you can, please help me with as many of the following as possible: a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card     (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668) c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong, so I can magicly get     everything working.

Here's a helpful hint: Running "Windows" under OS/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a DOS box. Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1 no longer has a "real mode". The ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows clipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added by IBM to "Win-OS/2". Now, everybody who is running "Windows" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2 2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running "Win-OS/2" under OS/2, raise YOUR hand. Get the picture, Cliff? ----

I've done some ASIC and digital design, but not any CPU design. It would seem to me that on a 486, the FPU is not being used, most of the cache is not being accessed, the off chip buffers/drivers are idle, the multiplier isn't multiplying, the barrel shifters aren't shifting, microcode isn't microcoding, etc.  This means transistors aren't switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS), which means less heat.\ From what I understand, the Pentium shuts down those sections of the CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power. --  Dennis Lou             || "But Yossarian, what if everyone thought that way?"

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure, but I have encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit responsibilty for, and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it. Everything is hunky-dory except the 3.5" floppy, which will read, but NOT WRITE diskettes.  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs. I have tried everything I can think of.

Hi, I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board. My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882 on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively, the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance. Andy --  Computing Coordinator                   Ontario, Canada.

I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display hardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat commonplace, so I'm sending a net-feeler. I have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit 720x280 display.  The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd | xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation, it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which isn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in mit/server/include/servermd.h: ---- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2 --- to: --- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2 --- Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either (a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte boundries? I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0. Thanks Brian
: Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  : like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first. You bet your bippy it's built like a tank.. and not just mechanically either!

There was a .303-bullet-sized hole in the aluminum siding with some solidified aluminum slag dripping from it. You could actually see the electrical box through the hole! The outlet itself was fried and I'm still amazed the whole damn house didn't burn down. I lost 2 electric garage door openers,  2 vcr's, 2 telephones (all of which were on the opposite side of the house), a ZyXEL U-1496E high speed modem, a VGA monitor, a 1024x768 color monitor, the RS232 and parallel ports on my X terminal and a WD LAN card in my PC. Not a good night! But, the DeskJet ran as soon as I found a functioning serial and parallel port to connect to it. Ted (slightly singed) Rypma HP Panacom Division Waterloo, Ontario

Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless. I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W. Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!! Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character?  Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF? --                                                                          ____  Deakin University, School of Engineering & Technology, Geelong, Australia \/
Is it possible to put more than 1 controller in a PC.  By this I mean of  different types.  ie.  RLL and MFM.  If so how do you access the drives in the CMOS setup.  Do they just show up to be configured or do you  have to do low level writes to the controller.   As an example put 1 RLL controller with 2 drives in a machine.  Put a MFM controller and 2 more drives connected to it.  I now have 4 drives with 2 controllers of different types.  Also can you  put 2 controllers of the same type into a PC and again how do you access  them.   I was asked this question and never tried to do it so if anyone has done this and can supply me with info I would very pleased Thanx in advance for any info... --

Hi, Terry. Its me again. I couldn't agree with you more. I finally received my Datadesk keyboard a month after sendng it to Datadesk to have it checked.  They didn't tell me over the phone that you had to wait before pressing the shift key to disable extensions. Actually, they did, but not until a day before my keyboard arrived. But a month earlier, they were of no help at all. I really think they need to put a disclaimer on their keyboard manual. -David

Hello, I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ, but couldn't find the answer. Anyway... The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best keyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click, etc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone? I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins & electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same.  Maybe the communication protocol is different?  Please answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible. In that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology. Thanks, Duco -- Duco Fijma               tel. X31-53-893718 University of Twente     fax.

Organization: =>ESKIMO NORTH (206) 367-3837 SEATTLE, WA.<= Hello, I've been following discussions on 17" monitors in  comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good reviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products as well as some others that may fit the bill.    I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI. I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large (=>17") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been very happy with a 16" on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home. I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic. Ok, stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are the products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what scan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and street cost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them?  Same info for Sony and Hitatchi. Thank you very much!!  --   ,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,  ,`,`Exercise a right today,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,  ,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,
Hello. I have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the powerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). Is there a difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus any other mac, say plus or ii?? I have heard, though not confirmed by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds. I also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem allowing speeds just as any other serial port. My particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud.  Currently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  I set everything up just as in lab and nothing.  In fact, the powerbook locks up. Can anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it.   I would prefer email since I don't read the news at all. I will post a summary if enough response is generated. Thanks.  Faisal M. Bhamani ps. If this topic has been discussed already, please excuse me and direct me to the appropriate places. thanks.

It's called the 68LC040. This is a redesign of the full 040 (which people are calling the 68RC040, although I have been told by a number of people that Motorola doesn't call the full '040 that) without the integrated FPU hardware.

A rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, so they don't have any immediate financial interest), told me that they have been having lots of problems with their Centris 610. He didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with the floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files. It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems and software compatibility problems with the machine. He's not recommending the Centris 610 to anybody; he says to consider a Centris 650 or a IIvx. (Why he would recommend a IIvx over an LCIII I don't know, but that's what he said.) So, what does the net think? Did the dealer just get one flaky machine, or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early? Is your C610 working just great, or is it buggy too? 	Jay Scott

While this is true, there are fixes for those who have already bought Diamond cards.  In Linux, for example, there are utilities that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course, this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X. I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card for specialized free software, avoid Diamond.  But if you already have one, there may be a fix that can help you.

I recently set Windows 3.1 up on my 486DX-33 VLB system, and I didn't notice until last night that I don't have the 386 icon in my control panel.  I don't remember Windows setup asking me about 386 enhanced mode (whether I wanted it or not).  Now I've got a program that I  just bought (Aldus Freehand 3.1) that is telling me that I should be running Windows in enhanced mode (looks like I'm running in standard mode). How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie?  Are there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows to not want to give you enhanced mode?  Thanks for any help!! -David Victor

I need help identifying this board that I found stuffed away in a corner. As the title says, all that is printed on it is NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS NB-DMA-8. It fits fine in my Mac IIci and snooper gives the very same name for the board.  It looks like it has an HP-IB connector on the back of it and another connector on the top (2 rows by 25 pins).  It also looks like it has an Intel processor on it (#A82380-16 Intel '86) On an EEPROM there is a sticker with the P/N 700584-01. Anybody ever seen or heard of one?

If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5") under MS Windows 3.1 via either Program Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell  has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not. The corruption is detected by executing "pkunzip -t b:\file.zip" after  both copies.  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption. Now here's the kicker: I have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps. Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the  DOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden). So, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running, and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive).  Under this  scenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the Windows apps and one slice for the running DOS app.   When copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks are essentially inactive.  Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and 95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices.  Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 =  .72 or 72% of the total available CPU time.  When copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell (no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task manager.  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice (assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice:  (1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time. So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU time?  Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy  copy?  It must be!

Sean O'Casey in _The White Plague_ by Frank Herbert. Hmmm... that's not quite right.  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close to the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution. Why else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business application.  What do you mean by 'no "retail price"'.  Quite the contrary, I think. The price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again, IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling required.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One price, medium performance, ready to go. When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears (*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and Bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who sells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I suspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know didly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any of the  Apple dealers I spoke with... If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure. I'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple Performa Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that decision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out with a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.   --  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Instrument Approach Procedures Automation             DOT/FAA/AMI-230 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there a hot-key for the Windows 3.1 screen saver utility?  If not, is there an easy way to create one?  The reason that I need one is that my dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly secure).  Also, the system manager won't let any software be added so  another program such as LOCK32.ZIP from cica or a different screen saver is out.

Subject: 'makedepend' problem Hi, netters: We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process #if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed by Sun) - namely Xos.h: #if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__) #       include <string.h> #       define  index   strchr #       define  rindex  strrchr #else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */ #       include <strings.h> #endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */ Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist under Solaris2. We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code. We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem. In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's distribution) mentions this problem: BUGS      If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C      preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way      that all #if directives will evaluate to  "true"  regardless      of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include      directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have      its own parser written for #if expressions. Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us? Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply  directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

It happened to my classic ii once.

We were wondering if Xpm or some other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X consortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by X.  Along the same subject line, is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used because it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes? or is it more involved? just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there for the 'original' format.

In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM, ethernet card, very high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP/IP for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole lot of $$$$).

I'm trying to turn on Xauthorization using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE on my servers (CPU heads, HP700RX Xterminals), but I'm running into a couple of problems. First, at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand  how to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization turned on.  Second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and I really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support Xauthorization. So, what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default, with non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based authorization. (Yes, I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals, but non-privileged users can't do this.) I've checked with the HP Support Line, and there doesn't appear to be a way. Can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what I want? BTW, I'm running HPUX 9.0, and Vue 3.0.

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file instead of your login-only one, which is fair enough if you only have a few users who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do what the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is to have your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment. Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts, it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the rest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set up as normal and inherited by everything.  You can find an almost-current copy of our scripts and things in contrib/edinburgh-environment.tar.Z, available from the usual places.  --  George D M Ross, Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh      Kings Buildings, Mayfield Road, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH9 3JZ

Hi all. I've been installing a new hard drive recently and have run into several terms that I'm not sure about. 1.) Hard Sectored/Soft Sectored -- What's the difference?  How do I know which to use? 2.) Head Skew & Cylinder Skew -- I understand that these are related to performance... How do I know what's optimal? My drive is an ESDI drive, if that makes a difference in discussing these terms. 		Any info/help is greatly appreciated! 				David

But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus.         I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz.         The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but         they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz.         So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at         33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.         So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on         a 33 mhz cpu.  EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as         fast as ISA. > Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher > cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than > and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a > Diamond SpeedStar 24X?

The EISA bus does have more advantages over the ISA bus than just it's width.  For example: more/better  interrupts and bus mastering.  But these other factors do not impact  a video card very much.  They have more impact on file servers with  multiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc. > Can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration? >  >  >

I've asked locally at my friendly Atari store. > I was told that it should be possible, but that they had no idea how > it might be done.  Nor did they particularly care to investigate. OK, here's my results so far.... 1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support    Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...) 2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved    with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.    If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-) 3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode. OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC which will act as a universal sync decoder. I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires. There are 2 reasons for doing this 1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're    in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example. 2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the    monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my    IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,    and I want to get that number down as much as possible.    Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA    will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,    I can get down to 1. Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor, but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait... -- Alan Brown
Somebody help me cure my poor computer before I go insane! I have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appears to be memory-related.  It's actually not limited to windows, but that's where it causes most of my problems.  Ths machine's 486DX33, 8Meg RAM, 256Kcache, TRIDENT TVGA card, PAS-16 soundcard. 1)  Windows runs REALLY, REALLY slow most of the time.  Slower than on my old 386SX16.  Graphics draws/fills are slow, boots are slow, applications are sluggish, dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear. appear to be related.  Several run slow, my .mod player crashes the system etc..) 2) Running Borland C++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other programs)  COMPLETELY fixes the problem.  Windows will run as fast as I've ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics than when I don't run BC beforehand. 3)  I don't have a memory manager installed in config.sys.  Installing emm386.exe does not fix the problem- it makes it worse.  After emm386 is installed, running BC will not fix the problem anymore. This problem is driving me nuts.  If you think you can help, please reply through the mail. Thanks, Evan

Hello, I saw this question posted a week or so ago, but as far as I could tell no answer appeared on the net. What is the good oil on connecting the Apple Extended Keyboard to a PowerBook? The earlier questioner wonderd if this would be too much of a load for the PB and as I want to connect just such a beast I am curious. I haven't got a PB yet so I can't RTFM but I assume that a standard keyboard with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet I read mentioned connecting an external keyboard. But is the Extended plus mouse pushing it? Any help gratefully recieved. I will summarise to the net if necessary. Thanks, John Collins. P.S. I am thinking of a PB160 but I assume that this would apply to all PB's.

Performa 200 == Classic II 	Performa 400 == LC II 	Performa 4xx == LC III 	Performa 600 == well, nothing :) 	The Performas are made to be low-cost business solutions.  The 4xx have bundled software, modems, etc. 	Because they have no "retail price" you might be able to get a steeper discount on them.  Shop around. 	As far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party.

In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them). If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions. This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz. note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows. Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure. If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it, then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a 20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance. You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources. Lawrence Khoo --

Hello Cliff  Many people on the internet (like us) have to pay for every byte of data passed through subscribed news groups. Bitmaps are large. Bitmaps cost us a lot of money. There are special news-groups for bitmaps because of this. We don't subscribe to them. Put you bitmaps in the right place. Read one of the FAQ guides in the newuser groups and it will tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of establishments like mine that you have just cost money. Some of them have very limited budgets. Go away. P.S. This is a flame ;-) P.P.S You distribution of "usa" didn't work.

I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my  hands on PC-Solaris...Unix for the Intel chip!  I know that there are many of other unix possibilities out there, but this includes the Wabi (Windows API Binary Interface...I think) technology that wil run Windows apps straight outta da box.  If this flies in enhanced mode, then here's another contender to look out for in the corporate/education market. Too big and complex for the home front...Windows 4/Mac Sys7 will take those while Win4Wkgrps - NT - OS/2 will fight it out for the small-to-mid businesses. However, once the PowerPC becomes available (especially in laptop/notebook form) then these will migrate into all markets....the ability to connect up to a unix machine at work and yet still run Windows/Mac apps at home is going to be real attractive to alot of people!!!

How do I get a subscription to MacWeek.  I want one, but I don't seem to be able to find a subscription card anywhere.
The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and non-commercial widgets is the ICS Widget Data book.  ICS sells the widgets for various prices.  There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery.  The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where  you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you  can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate  widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them.  The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets such as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex  widgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to.  This is the extent that I know about them except that I got their  databook catalog  and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there) I dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them. hope this helps you. --  Brian Dealy                |301-572-8267| It not knowing where it's at   !uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy   |            | where it's not at...

Hi ppl, I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german keyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine. I have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11, so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr. My first impression was very good, I was able to get Z and Y straight :) There's still a little problem I can't solve however: I cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets. The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work. I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does. Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry "Mode_switch" which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd?? My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't. If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them, help would be appreciated. CU Alaric
I am just beginning to try using the Athena toolkit and am having some problems  getting started.  I think that some files are missing on the system, but there is the possibility that they are just in a different directory.  When I try to link my program it can't find XtInitailize, XtRealizeWidget, XtMainLoop,  XtCreateManagedWidget, or commandWidgetClass.  I've included Intrinsic.h and Command.h.  I also had a problem on compile with XtNcallback but replaced that with a NULL in order to compile and see if there were any other problems.  I haven't  used a toolkit before and this is simply an example I got from the manuel.  Can someone tell me where I might look for these calls, that is, in what file not what directory they are supposed to be under because the system manager doesn't believe in standard directories and generally does things his own way.  (I am using UNIX) Thank you for your assistance. T. J. Adamsson

Hello,     I'm trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts (which occur every .055 seconds, or 18.2 times a second) to time people's response times, in a psychology experiment, and the response times are on the order of .01 seconds. Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting ticks? Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently? I'm trying to do this in DOS 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if this could also work on our old 8086 machines running DOS 2.1 (I know, I know, I don't like them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement, just a possibility.      So, basically, any information on the BIOS tick scheme and the related inrterruots would be appreciated, as well as any information on alternate ways of improving accuracy. Email is preferred, as I'm planning on posting this to a few boards, and I don't read all of them. Thanks Joe

> I understand that if I have a correct adapter then I can >use a vga monitor with my IIsi. > Are those adapters working with specific brands? > Is adapter for NEC or Sony working with other brands? > I will be using a vga monitor with IIsi for a month soon. > I don't have any clue what monitor will be. Here's the story: (1)  The IIsi *cannot* supply a VGA output.  However... (2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal the Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch "high resolution color display"---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode. So, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you need (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the VGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use it's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over the VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot produce). As far as (a) above is concerned, contact  James Engineering, Inc.  6329 Fairmount Ave.  El Cerrito, CA  94530  510-525-7350  FAX: 510-525-5740 want the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to have your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer will just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want an adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style connectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction. As far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of 67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison, the VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and a 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate. The monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes in the PC compatible world.

Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library. For Network discussion... Color Coordination...     I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the   year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow   (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no   one responded at all.     The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly   you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself   solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead   of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.   ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers,   Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... .     The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.   Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this   table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''.      * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors              EG: values   0, 128 and 255.        This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the        standard colors for use in icons.      * two extra shades of grey              EG: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)      * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading        a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.     This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of   posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the   workstation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   A Gods idea of amusement is a Snakes & Ladders game, with greased rungs.                                            - Terry Pratchett   "Wyrd Sisters" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I wouldn't advise wasting your time with Apple.  They'll treat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers (a personal opinion). The safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitor's scanning rates with Apple's rates.  I don't know Apple's video scanning rates, but I use the Micron Xceed 30's rates, as they're a good approximation. About cables: you just have to go out to someplace like Fry's and get a few Mac-VGA cables and try them out.  I have a ViewSonic 5E (14") and I use an NEC adaptor.  Other monitors may use other adaptors.  I also have a Mac->832x624 adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is an Apple 16".  I need to readjust the vertical and horizontal sizes but it works fairly well. 	"Just like everything else in life, the right lane ends in half a mile." Ravi Konchigeri.

Which would YOU choose, and why? Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50. I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit). I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU). How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost? Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost? Thanks for any comments. Randy

Hello, I have a problem with X11R5 on a Sun386i an I hope that someone can help me with it. I've built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got (I think 23). Building was easy. After installing everything I started X but nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed, the machine seemed to hang. I loged in from another machine an found the Sun386i running well. 'ps' told me that there's a X-server and a xterm running. And with some  experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^D I blindly hit the xterm, endet the session and got my prompt back. I guess it's a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet. I've got a Sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ACE-6 0688 94V-0, Rev 53) SunOS 4.0.2 and ROM 4.4. Please help me. I'm able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to other machines but that's not what I did it for. Thanks in advance, Stefan

I have a small network running in my dorm at school, and I am kind of worried about the length of the wires and the way that I have run it. I was wondering if anyone might have some schematic or at least some ideas on how to make some sort of simple appletalk repeater.  I'm not so interested in making actual zones and zone names, just a way to isolate different branches of the network. Does anyone have any ideas on what could be done?? Thanks alot, Dave Sugar

Can anyone offer any solutions? or know the phone # to GCC Technologies? Thanks in advance Charles,
I bought a 386DX-40 motherboard for 50$... no documentation at all. Everything appears to work, except I'm having trouble getting a few of the LED connectors working. I've looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards, but the pin configuration doesn't look anything like what is on this board. Does this pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there???

I need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks (3.5") and ideally would like to be able to keep 2 to 4 floppies busy simultaneously on a single PC. [Yes, I know that services to do this exist.]  I know that standard ISA bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active at a time. I know that some controllers are available that can handle 4  floppies with serialized access. I know that microchannel machines can keep  more than one floppy active simultaneously. But does anyone have a controller  for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going? How about for an EISA machine? If the limitation is a software limitation, I can work around that by using OS/2 1.3 on my PC-286.

Thanks in advance also. :  : Bill Willis :  1. do not do a low level format on an IDE drive unless you have the    executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer.  These are    available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal    fee. 2. In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also    another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  Get it right! 3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to    pin 1.  No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable.  Be sure of pin 1    on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok    but assumptions are bad). 4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct,    then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format.    I have NEVER personally found this necesary, but perhaps there is    something gone wrong with the data on the disks?  Probably not but    I understand your predicament - You will probably throw salt over    your shoulders, wear funny clothes and do a spooky sounding chant    while dancing around the room if someone said it might help.

>Is there an extension cord type cable I can buy which allows me to plug >my existing power cord into and then plug this "extension cable" into my >Quadra?  There are two approaches: 1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go from the monitor to the back of the computer. 2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the computer. Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at good prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking for some special thing at a Mac store.

You shouldn't have ignored the ZyXEL.  It can be purchased with a "Mac bundle", which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and FaxSTF software. The bundle adds between $35 and $60 to the price of the modem, depending on the supplier.  It is true that the modem has no Mac-specific docs, but it doesn't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting &D0 in the init string, to enable hardware handshaking).

I just ordered my 4DX2-66V system from Gateway.  Thanks for all the net discussions which helped me decide among all the vendors and options. Right now, the 4DX2-66V system includes 16MB of RAM.

I've never taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what I've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue. again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated the Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who HAVE worked with the Sportster. personally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right now. and now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info). >The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression. just as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary mode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes. and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one). >The difference >with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode.  take a second look at the original question: >>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST modem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST. also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb. >This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of >the same type unit to achieve this speed. HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about HST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a proprietary modulation scheme. >The Sportster will do >asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way >only. I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way..... first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual). second, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction, and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if you're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course, a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions. V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time. third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics. >The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available. again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large footprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem. later.....    --jim -- #include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ E-mail me for information about KAMterm (host mode for Kantronics TNCs).

Those >who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm >looking for. Well, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better. 1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon.    That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You    can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left    side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your "left    and right window" as you can have as many open as you wish instead     of just two. 2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking    on the executable's icon. 3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double    clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have    associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The    "browse" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you    name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.    files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your    requirement for "text reading and graphics viewing". I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up all the associations you need is the way to do it. If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be pretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how some things are done. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Iskandar Taib                          | The only thing worse than Peach ala
>are we talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller >or           >are we talking about a SCSI-1 Controller that had a chip upgrade >using the same chip that is on a SCSI-2 controller board. we are talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller. Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section: SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous}  SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these  modes is mainly in the software drivers.  Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end.   Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for  a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using  SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which  results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit  and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software  drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI  interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term  'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit}. 8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2  that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1 electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider 16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but 4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1 but is 8-bit SCSI-2. Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2. 8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.
hello all- i have a problem with my micro solutions backpack- sometimes  it works, sometimes it doesnt.  i will either start a backup, or  start a tape format, and at about 20 percent i get an error either saying the tape is bad or the backup/format has aborted for an unknown reason. if i turn everything off and wait a half hour it works fine.  is it because the tape backup is too warm?  has anyone had similar experiences? thanks, kevin

Of course, the keycode of XKeyPressedEvent is O.K. Can anybody verify this ?     Did I do anything wrong ?  	 Thanks. -- Edward Der-Hua Liu CS department National Taiwan University, Taiwan

An application we *must* use requires upper-case input.  I'd like to be able to simply move my cursor into the window where that application is running (just a text window, xterm or some such) and have everything I type be entered as ALL CAPS.  When the cursor is in any of my many other windows, I want to automatically return to normal functionality.  I have point-to-type set. Is there a way to do this in X (specifically OW 3.0 on SPARCs)?  Is there a way to mess with .Xdefaults to make a category of window do this?  Any hints would be most appreciated.  I program in C but not X, although I can pick up somthing that's not too involved.

   Wasn't the shareware fee a "suggestion" by John?    Is so then it's up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to    honour it and part with money.  Personally if I was in his position I would    do exactly the same thing, John has obviously put in lot of time and effort    into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it. It is interesting to look at the change(s) of mind that John has had. The AUTHOR file for xgif (an early incarnation of xv) reads (in part)  as follows...   Do whatever you want with this program, though it *would* be nice if my name   remained on it somewhere...  Other than that, it may be freely modified,   distributed, and used to fill up disk space. The README file for xv 1.00 (?) reads (in part) as follows...   NOTE:  If you like the program and decide to use it, *please* send me a short   email message to that effect.  Be sure to mention the full name of your   organization.  When our sponsors ask us 'what have you been doing', it would   be most handy to be able to come up with a nice long list of organizations   that are using code developed in the GRASP Lab.

Also, if you find XV to be nifty, useful, generally 'cool', and of   some value to you, your donation (not tax-deductable) would be greatly   appreciated.  $10 (U.S.) is probably a fine amount to donate.   Folks who donate $25 and up will receive a nice, bound copy of the XV Manual   printed on a spiffo 600-dpi laser printer.  It'll look lovely mounted over   your fireplace.

Oh yeah, I did hear about a power supply called a  "Silencer" - which is supposed to be more quiet. Has anyone had experience with this? I was quoted a price of $225 (!) for a 270Watt Silencer. I've even considered stuffing my PC case in one of those acoustic "printer  enclosures", but that wouldn't be the most elegant solution. Also, I'm  guessing that would also cut the ventilation.

  At work we have a small appletalk network with 3 macs and  couple of printers. We also have a PC that has some specialized accounting software that we would  like to operate from any of the macs. We have Soft PC, and I have found that the software works just fine under it, but I would like to have all of the data for the program reside at one place (the PC hard disk). So my question for you is(actually questions)  1) is there a board for the PC that will allow you to hook into an appletalk     network?  2) if #1 is possible, is there any software/hardware combination that will      allow me to mount the PC hard disk as a networked disk on the macs so I     can use Soft PC to run the application?  3) if #1 or #2 is impossible, is there any other way to accomplish what I am     after? --  _______________________________________________________________________________ Chris Parrish                        |    University of Oklahoma               |    "To share is to split..."   
Hi, I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1). Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different values for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my application defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and not when the resources are loaded on demand. Is there a proper solution to this? So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2 different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color. But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH). Furthermore, I thought of using #include "XTerm" in XTerm-color. However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color, things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource is used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do about it? I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I can use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the resource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?

Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. To recapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor momentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right after I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that radically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens with no provocation whatsoever. I have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the problem was that the 13" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's power supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was really wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that it had to be endured.) This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13" monitor owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the  Apple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading Jitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that, the swap of a circuit board. I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had experience with this sort of thing.

I ordered an external floppy drive from them 2 years ago.  When I placed the order, they said it was in stock and would ship the next day.  A week passed and no drive.  I called them up and they said they were out of stock and my drive should ship in 2 weeks or so.  Since I needed the drive right away (both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead) I cancelled my order and haven't dealt with them since. Chris Kidwell

I have a Logitech 256grays hand scanner from a PC.  I'm wondering if anyone has been successful in connecting the scanner to a mac?  It has the same connector and is a serial device on the pc.  I can imagine the pins coniguration would need to changeed, but I'm not sure if the signal levels would be correct, and if the mac s/w would work with it.   Of course the manuals say nothing about the interface, connector layout or anything H/W-ish! Any ideas?? thanx, Steve
I am having troubleloading my Logitech Scanman Driver (latest version) into high memory with the devicehigh command in MSDOS 6. It gives me an 'invalid parameters' message. Is it necessary to change some of the scanner driver parameters when loading high? Any help would be appreciated     Ronel
Boy am I glad that I didn't start out with one of thos PS/2 computers. I started the upgrade operation out by spending $235 for a AMD386DXL-40 Forex upgradable mother board from Midwest Micro.

    Hello X'ers I have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. The following code illustrates the problem: #include <stdio.h> #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <X11/Xutil.h> main() {         Display *display;         Window win;         XVisualInfo vinfo;         Colormap colormap;         XSetWindowAttributes attributes;         XEvent event;         Status status;         display=XOpenDisplay(NULL);         status=XMatchVisualInfo(display,DefaultScreen(display),24,TrueColor,                 &vinfo);         if (!status){                 fprintf(stderr,"Visual not found\n");                 exit(1);         }         colormap=XCreateColormap(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),                 vinfo.visual,AllocNone);         attributes.colormap=colormap;         win=XCreateWindow(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),0,0,100,100,                 0,24,InputOutput,vinfo.visual,CWColormap,&attributes);         XMapWindow(display,win);         for (;;){                 XNextEvent(display,&event);         } } I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP 9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change), both running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on HP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request. As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the visual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. What am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the same error.

It's been on the price list here at Dartmouth : since they released it and it has never been called the "DuoDock Plus."  It was a paper from Apple Sweden that announced some new products (the new docking station was only one of them), and the paper arrived before it showed up on the price list. I don't know if it's still called the "DuoDock Plus" in the price list, it could be a mistake by someone at Apple Sweden. /Mats --  Uppsala University Computing Center (UDAC)     Ph:  +46 18 187817 Department of medical systems                  Fax: +46 18 187825 Sweden                                         Think straight - be gay!

In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running at night and on weekends. Computer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use of electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five percent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for ten percent by the year 2000. If you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF when you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do. Also, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed by the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the computer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy- efficient PCs that "power down" automatically when not being used and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and New Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual electricity bills.  Look for the special EPA "Energy Star" logo when you buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years. According to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2 emissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million automobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants responsible for acid rain. Please do your part ... be responsible.

< <>OW 3.0 is the same.  But, the definition of broken is relative.  Pageview <>requires DSC compliant PostScript files, in order to stop at page breaks. <>I don't consider that broken.

It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need to be DSC compliant.  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing at Sun.  I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview program does require DSC compliant PostScript.  There was the possibility that it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it would stop at each showpage.  I believe that this method would preclude being able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go forward to the next showpage.  This isn't in OW3.0 pageview, but maybe it is in the Solaris 2.x version of OW (OW 3.1?). In any event, I find pageview extremely useful.  Since all of the PostScript that I produce IS DSC compliant, I don't have any problems. --  harvard\   ucbvax!uwvax!astroatc!ftms!brown  or  uu2.psi.com!ftms!brown rutgers/
>IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA, >and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to >do directly with SCSI. No.  The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA.  The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.  These controllers tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.  To get the DMA benefits, IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*. >> For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is >>issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other >>devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do >>something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be >>what I am doing while reading this group. >You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it >could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The >hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has    >nothing to do with SCSI. Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands. The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data. >>Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, >>thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is >>better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to >>completely get rid of IDE. >And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask. >Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS/2 type OS do all the miraculous things >with an IDE harddrive that it can with a (single) SCSI hard drive. The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the  devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business. Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback.   Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system? --David Willmore --  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Willmore  | "Ever noticed how much they look like orchids?

I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows. Specifically, I am working on an application that generates formatted reports. Since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is: 1.  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in Visual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit? As I have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get around the above problem, I am working on the following approach: I am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word, using the WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic(VB) and load this template of mine, which will work in the following way: It will first open MyOwn.INI file (created in VB - at the time when the user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the .INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file. 1.  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way to specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file? 2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to read more than the 32k at one time? --- Any help will be appreciated.
I've installed many X apps, and have that many of them Imakefiles that have lines startingwith XCOMM in them. When I do a xmkmf to create the Makefile, the Makefile also has the XCOMM (comment?) lines in them. I always have to edit out these lines because the make command barfs on them. I was wondering what these lines were for, and what I might be doing wrong that causes the make command to dislike them. Thanks!
Ok, I just got a new 486/66 16 Mb, with a ATI Ultra pro and I can't get into windows. It says that I need more memory available, but I have 15mb ogf extended mem & 512k of conventionnal. I have disabled my memory aperture because it didn't find any "FREE" memory, but it still gave me a message that the memory aperture will conflict with system memory. I think that's why it want to get in Windows. Any help will greatly be appriciated. Please Reply by mail, because this site is a week late on News 					Thanks 					Gel

I'm afriad that's not true.  The monitor problem seems to occur whenever the 15" Mag monitor is put into 1024x768 mode.  I'm running OS/2 at 1024 and the same symptoms appear. It does not seem like a video card problem as the Cirrus Logic 5426 chip and the ATI GUP seem to cause these problems... two VERY  different cards. 						Glenn
I have a 286 with a Western Digital WD-93044A hard drive. This drive is  782 cylinders with 4 read write heads PHYSICALLY, but LOGICALLY it is 977 cylinders with 5 read write heads (??!!).  In the CMOS setting I am instructed to set it to type 17 (IBM 977 cyl. 5 read/write heads), THE PROBLEM:  I was sent Western Digitals ISPFMT low level program from the manufacturer, and was instructed to run it on the hard drive with the CMOS setting set to type 17.  This worked "o.k." and I verified the disk using the same program.  I then reloaded DOS which did a high level format, again no errors, no bad sectors, etc. BUT.... when I run Norton Speedisk 6.01 (or any other disk optimizer) with the verify option set ON, I get ERROR verifying sector NNNN, where NNNN can be any number (not the same all the time). ANY IDEAS AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WOULD BE APPRECIATED! Thank you! Steve Hamilton

| Does anyone out there know of a way to have a UNIX machine automatically | set it's display variable to that of the Xterm you're using when it's | not the machine that's serving you X?  | | The best I've been able to come up with has been a rather convoluted  | script that extracts your IP # from the whos command, and it  | frequently fails, not to mention that it requires having your user | name added to it. | |    -- Andrew Inman, Consultant, ITD Consulting and Support Services | | From my own notes on this subject.... Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another.   This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current DISPLAY that is being used. 1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual)       Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote   machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands.          xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge -   This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire   program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote   command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth)      Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do   this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow   you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes   the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required.      The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also   pass environment variables, as well as the current directory.  You will   however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for   passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories.     WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible   in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization   information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended.   The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from   the view of other users. 2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable.       This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass   the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of   an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information   from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly.     A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does   this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the   actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your   authorization.     On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the   TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or   stty'ing your terminal.   ---8<---   script for launching rlogin:     #!/bin/sh     # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:     if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then       case "$DISPLAY" in         :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;       esac       TERM="$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`"       export TERM     fi     rlogin $*   ---8<---   add to your .cshrc or .login     if ( $?TERM ) then       if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then         echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge -         setenv DISPLAY `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f2`         setenv TERM    `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f1`       endif     endif   ---8<---   xterm command to use     xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname   ---8<--- 3/ NFS.      Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.    Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization    is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your    DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE:       login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host       remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host` 4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file       This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or   `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information.   This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering   the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each   individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known   by others, nor should it be easy to determine.     A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give   the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone   who is asking.     This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill   I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave   up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but   less secure. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------     "Magic is Real -- unless declared an integer"  ---  John P.Melvin ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only dos based application   I have is ProcommPlus.  In my config.sys I have emm386 loaded with the   option noems (no expanded memory). Following a thread in one of the comp   newsgroups, I read that it was no necessary to have emm386 loaded. Indeed,   in the manual, it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out of   extended memory. Since I have the noems option, it seems to me that the   emm386 device is useless in my case.  Should I use emm386 or should I remove it from my config.sys? Thanks for your help, -Eric

The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says >that they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks... >| Brian J Schaufenbuel I don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake), I see this as something that was designed-in intentionally. So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA) would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may  begat an update to the motherboard board design. What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT  along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple. If I were you I would be cautious about this. You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' 32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board. Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother- board.  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.  I'm attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the AIR board. Model number of AIR board (with 486-33DX) is B433EI2.

Personally, I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing what it does so well, I hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. I'd hate to be one who actually does innovate, and then have Microsoft come in like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff, marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. I don't have all that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft, since they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over antitrust fears. However, for other companies and individuals who have a great idea, yet get it "borrowed" by larger corporations who can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from the original innovator, I feel much sympathy.

I've been playing with a centris 610 (8/230) for the last couple weeks.  The only problem that I have seen is that a couple of the applications I run are incompatible with the 040's processor cache, so I have to run with it turned off.

Hello, recently I noticed there is a directory named "DiskImage" in my disk.  I didn't notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of  the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files. I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space.  Does anybody know if this is just  something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

These   are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the   performance of your workstation.   Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more   hardware is always even a necessity.   This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different   people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X   Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.   Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must   balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal   decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.   This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.   However, they are outside the scope of this document.     [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook     "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  IMHO, it contains a     well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm     unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.] ----------------- Table of Contents -----------------   0.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few   months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably   locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.   If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does   not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can   retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.   There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about   them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the   news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.   The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document   can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If   you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by   command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body. ----------------------------- What about the "Other X FAQ"? -----------------------------   well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.   The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: 	"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details). --------------- Window Managers ---------------   There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.    A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".   Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:   -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is   the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)   and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the   display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ The X Server ------------ Which Server? - - - - - - -   Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.   If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.   On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between   the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to   me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging.     How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market. Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and   does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help   performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few   pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone   who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.   Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - -     If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep     for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my     .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...     we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.   This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!     why this works, which I have summarized here:     When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.     Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation's limited resources   This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.   Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &   I've experimented with: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &   I've even tried: 	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &     [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]   All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.   One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.   eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since   I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server. About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -     Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves   One suggestion:     In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH: 	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N     [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]     So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.     This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). 	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]   This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:     - Easier to maintain / more usable.     - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.     - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.   It also has drawbacks:     - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application's resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to "xrdb" again.     - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!       I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.       The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.     - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.     - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find   A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for   clients that I seldom use. Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.   See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.   "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn't set specially."   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.   I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if   you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.] ------- Clients -------   If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?   Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.   [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]   I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.   The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.   Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment. A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo    available: on export.lcs.mit.edu    Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.    Saves screen real estate. 2) mclock    available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar    Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look    very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing    resources.   Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and    takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.   :-)  A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   From the README file distributed with xterm:   +-----   |		 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here   |   | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.   | ...   +-----   Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that   xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.   Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.   If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines 1) Xvt    available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z    "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get    hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as    xterm is rather a hog! "    This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to    rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current    version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any    yet.    UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.    As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.    So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.    If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.    relative speed of each 2) mterm    available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in      /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.    "I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is    scrollback, but some people like it anyway." Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - -   Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.   Text Field Widgets:     I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].   This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests? ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions ------------------------- Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.   - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)   - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm     conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.     I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.   - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway. 			for reminding me of this one. --ed.] A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.     e.g. (for twm) :       menu "mouse settings" {         "Mouse Settings:"			f.title 	"  Very Fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &" 	"  Normal (Fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &" 	"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"	! "xset m default &" 	"  Glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &"       } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -     To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:     - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.     - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.     - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)     - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.     - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)   [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]   - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.     Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.   - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.     This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     same operation between client and server.   I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.     The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------   Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.     A lot more tips on performance are in the paper "Improving X     Application Performance" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in     Issue 3 of The X Resource.     An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992     conference proceedings.     This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers. -------------- Author & Notes --------------   Suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list   are gladly accepted.

Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical modeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol. Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  She's very helpful. 	MainSoft 	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at runtime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go straight to Xlib.  They don't yet support MFC.  They're at 415 896 0708. 	Bristol 	This company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon. My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles. --       Daniel L Smith, Autodesk, Sausalito, California, (415) 332-2344 x 2580 disclaimer:  accuracy of statements corrrelates somehow to caffeine intake
   Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software    programming to change the IP numbers on an ethernet card? The Ethernet card doesn't use the IP number (32-bits, usually #.#.#.#); it uses the Ethernet address (48-bits, usually #:#:#:#:#:#). I have never run across an Ethernet controller that cannot be programmed to use an address that is not assigned to it. DECNET requires this feature. However, that said, there is no reason to ever change the Ethernet address.  They are globally unique, the first three bytes being assigned to the manufacturer by the IEEE, and the last three by the manufacturer.

We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the Sparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for PC (presumably Windows) clients? Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be  *much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP (with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but are there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard PPP w/ compression and XRemote? Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks. -- Rob --  Rob Ryan, System Constructs Inc.
Hello again, About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I received.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so you can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a wide range of comments, each has its own value.   There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability of the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around summertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first inkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will print, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets (laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well, that's a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY! =========================================================================== >Hello fellow 'netters. > >I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I >should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

Just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the HP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows). I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders too.  If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY was two days. Good luck! Motorola Communications & Electronics Inc. Glen Rock,  NJ =========================================================================== I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality 'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few 'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType but haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only. For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via the HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as 'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general. >From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects. However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from Epson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing laser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX - something I think? I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.   =========================================================================== About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is incredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever do stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've had are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on cheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve inches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other complaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet. The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it between now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine from a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend who has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone has drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow! Hope I helped! (360dpi sure looks great!)

I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality are similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet for home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be the case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use cut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.   Just my $0.02 worth.. --  Mike Mattix Agricultural Group of Monsanto P.O. Box 174 Luling, LA 70070 ===========================================================================   Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the translation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the note.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around the paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics resolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to: Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and could not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not. I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration the Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet. I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I spent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at work this month anyway. Regards Mike Mattix Ag Group of Monsanto Luling, LA =========================================================================== I spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet BJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were: 1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon 2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference 3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment. The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the BJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think. As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anything big with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one comes from - Microsoft?) Hope this helps. --  Thomas V. Frauenhofer, WA2YYW =========================================================================== Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-)) I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better, but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at least 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in other "new" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently available.. > Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 > dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi). > Which is faster?

Which will handle large documents better (75 I've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me Canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one with the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in printing- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better.. Greetz, Kris =========================================================================== When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet. We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print quality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by HP. 							-Nate =========================================================================== Whenever I buy anything I look at what the "experts" say, pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've been unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers. I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the result. I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still readily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my views/experience: 	1.	I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away 		from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with 		the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio. 	2.	I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the 		ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes 		they have the expertise. 	3.	The 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly 		acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from 		Windows. 	4.	I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured 		typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!) 		and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is 		pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor... 	5.	The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers. 	6.	If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty 		slow with it, God knows what it's like without! I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily use.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate. Hope this is of use. Regards David	 =========================================================================== Just bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with $50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the DeskJet in print quality.          I don't print long docs, though.          excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up          close; you can see a lot more "jaggies" than on a LaserJet.          The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the          page/print head in place, I would imagine. Large docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...          manual says up to 100, though.  Haven't tried it.          the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though. Know nothing of add-on costs. =========================================================================== >The deskjet is SLOW.  This is in comparison to the other printers I >mentioned.  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares. > >The interface between Win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, I've not >had any problems with it. I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical ( depending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy. --- Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications =========================================================================== Wow, it's funny you should ask this.  I'm a little behind in news reading so I know this may be late.   I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried that I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is fantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed DAMN near laser quality.  You can't tell it's not laser unless you get 2 inches from the page.   no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskette which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it under Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet to install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them.   I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well ut I felt it was awfully slow.  And much noisier than the BubbleJet.  I won't say the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more.  Just my $0.02 worth. -=- Brett =========================================================================== -- Sincerely, "In theory, theory and practice are the same.  In practice, they are not."

	Help, 	I've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across 	the top (a toolbar).  I wanted to add eventhandlers to these 	pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that 	I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each 	pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it. 	I've done this fine, but I've turned up the following problem: 	When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of 	the above events, but when they are not sensitive I only get 	callbacks on LeaveWindow events.  This seems odd.  I would 	expect this to be an all-or-nothing type of thing. 	Is this a bug?  If not, can someone explain this behavior? 	thanks, 	Mark

The first problem was the sound.  I tried the M0, but then even the logon was muted.  I don't want that.  Any other suggestions for that hissing? The second is really strange.  First, I kept mentioning that FC slowed down all the time and took too long.  Well I just logged on with extensions off and I didn't have any slowdown.  Also, last time I was online I quit (which usually disconnects and quits).  It disconnected but it wouldn't quit.  I had to force quit, and then when I launched FC again it said the modem port was in use.  This is really strange.  I thought it might have to do with fax software.  Or the restart could have reset the modem port (a more likely explanation).  So, any suggestions? -David **** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

	Greetings, 	We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1 and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to run Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays. 	When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness. With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged.   	Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the department chair, it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm, and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server).  	Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? 	Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? 	How about obvious gimmes? 	And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it? 	Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Systems Programmer and TA, Tufts University Computer Science Dept.

I cannot make out ANY difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or not (If you think about it a bit, a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of time for even the slowest PC). Since you would of course only enable the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this  application is active anyway. To repeat it, a blinking text cursor costs almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when designing the xterm software.

This package out of 1986(?) should be a full TCP/IP fro the DOS-machines. Is there anyone out there that's using it? I want to connect a DOS-machine to my OS/2 machine... Tell me what the DOS-machine should run (sample CONFIG and AUTOEXEC would be great) and where I can find a nfs client. I understand that a telnet and a ftp client are part of the package. I've got the Crynwr package drivers, but that's it!

Subject: ** EPS CLIP ART ** 4Sale Less than 1/2 of mailorder price! I have three libraries, all on CD, which cost me over two thousand dollars mail order.  They are all genuine, high quality EPS vector graphics (NOT just some scans with a silly EPS wrapper!)  They are: 1. Totem Graphics color EPS library (about 1400 color EPS images).    This costs a thousand bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as    high quality (much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art, SOTMC clip art,    etc., in my opinion), but I rate both the 3G library and the C.A.R.    library as higher.  Totem's art is ALL color -- whereas most of the other's    are B&W.  It's the best all-color library out there, in my opinion. 2. C.A.R. Graphics library (haven't counted how many images, but you can    purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size).    This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as    very high quality, but it's only B&W. 3. 3G Graphics library (very popular in all the Mac mags).  This costs    about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as very high quality    (got some awards in one of the major Mac mags, forgot which).  Some of    the images are color, but most are B&W. For what it's worth, all three of the CD's are saved in multiple file formats. They are readable on Mac's and PC's.  Additionally, Totem's will mount native- NeXT also, although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC filesystems.  I've personally tested the CD's on all three machines (I've owned all three machines, although I sold my NeXT a few months ago). Also, in my opinion, the 3G and C.A.R. libraries are the best in the business (and I've seen lots).  Also, Totem's is, in my opinion, the best all-color library around, although I like 3G's color art better. I want $850 for everything.  Can ship certified check C.O.D., as well as VISA/MC charge.  If you pay by VISA/MC, I'll ship pre-paid in the continental U.S. If I ship C.O.D., buyer pays freight and C.O.D. fee. Reason for selling: No longer have DTP business.

Hi Mac fans, I have some problems with my new Quadra 700. Several programs (Mathematica 2.1, AfterDark-Mandelbrot module) causes a systemcrash if the 040Cache is active. Do anyone have a list of programs which are compatible and which are not? Do anyone have some hints for the  use of the Quadras perfomence? Thanks Joerg
Has anybody had a chance to find out how the new HP Laser Jet 4L behaves with Windows ?  Daniel Royer
Can anyone recommend a 3 button mouse that is compatible with MacX and Quadra? If so, can the buttons be programed to say, cut, paste etc? Can anyone suggest a supplier? The only 3 button mice I know exist are: 	1. Logitek	$106.00 Aust (Injan ). 	2. Anorus	$100.00 Aust (Mac direct). Are these ok for the above configuration?

I thought I'd share a good experience, too.  I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero footprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on the front panel and the case was metal).  While traveling with it (it was in my SE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs holding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel was coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situation until it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out). I called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the tab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers -- though nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my modem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm never flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether I could send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem with that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a day (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced under warranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class insured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed Ex by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was traveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]). The only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked to, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the drive mechanism out and send just the case.  Unfortunately, I discovered the day I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little seal and thus voiding the warranty!  Oh, well. Al

After setting up a very large (>4 pages) table in Word for Windows I asked word to print it to my HP laserjet II -- worked fine at first. After much editing of the table contents (but not structure) output requests now kick the LJ into manual feed mode for the document containing the table.  Other documents without tables print correctly. Where should I look and what should I change to get the document with the long table to use the paper drawer rather than kick into manual feed mode? [I believe I've tried all the obvious printer manager changes as well as replacing the hppcl.[lp]00 files with archived versions.] Thanks for any and all help.

I am looking for a printer utility which stay in Window 3.1 as an icon and let you drag a file to it to issue the printing.
I have just upgraded from a Trident TVGA9000 to an ATI Graphics Ultra (the old mach8 chip).  I am quite pleased with the performance so far, but have one problem.  When using windows in 800x600, I have noticed that the  tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when I was using the Trident card.  Is there a setting in my .ini files that I can change to make these smaller ?  I could not find the FAQ for this list... 		--Mike
>How does Print Manager deal with multiple printers?   >>> We're planning... <<< >...to print to two "printers" from an application.  One will be a >real printer, and the other a... >>> fax program. <<< >...  Will Print Manager >just deal with the jobs one at a time, or will it feed to both >printers at once? > Please research carefully.  Just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality  when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely installed" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the  fax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX's peculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager program merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  To software, it appears the job was "printed".  Print Manager  plays NO part in the handling of the actual process. Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were up to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering. Good luck.

Has anybody heard about a thing called a MacWatch? I saw it on TV a couple of years ago, it is a watch with a reviever and a transmitter for your mac. The practical upshot is that your Mac can page your watch and display a small message. My flatmate is off to the states for a week or two soon and I am interested in getting one. Any info would be appreciated. Thanx in advance. Glenn.

I need some advice regarding monitor to use with Xfree86. I have an ET4000 based graphic card with 1 Meg of memory. I know this card is supported in Xfree86 because a friend of mine has one of these in his PC. His monitor is 17" colour capable of displaying 1280x1024 resolution. I cant afford this kind of expensive monitor. I heard from somewhere that Xfree86 requires multisync monitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60KHz. Is this true? I would only like to use Xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and so was thinking of buying a cheap 14" SVGA monitor. Interlaced (Cheap)14" SVGA  monitors only have have maximum horizontal scan frequency of about 38KHz. Will this kind of monitor work with Xfree86?  Please reply by email.

Well,     You can always try and find a PC dealer who sells guaranteed memory. I work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundreds of computers per year.  It never fails, machines come in with BAD SIMMS. Now for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashed I can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or designed the software.     Well, I don't think that way anymore, especially with the results I have gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work. The moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good.  I would be willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once in awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell.     I just got plain SICK of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine just crashed and they lost thier work.  In case your wondering, or if you haven't already guessed I work in an IS department.  Service is a do or die perogative in this line of work, so the MORAL IS:  HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTED with a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little software programs that you can run in your machine.  SIMMS are complicated little beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively. If any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices which are not cheap, write me back.  They make life a little bit easier, and besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide. -Greg Carter

The 486 at the same CLOCK is NOT as fast as the 040 at the same clock speed.  The '040 also has much better floating point unit. Now the DX2-66 is faster than the '040 at 33Mhz.  But for your reference the 486 at 33 mhz gets ~14MIPS while the '040 at 33mhz gets ~20MIPS.

I have found that you should observe the following with almost all new equipment : Check for warrany tape.  If none, carefully open unit. Inspect for loose wires, jumpers, screws, and other trash. Clean up these manufacturing mistakes. *Now* power up the unit and check it out. I can't think of how many things I've bought that weren't okay right out of the box due to sloppy QC. - Jonathan PS : This goes for any manufacturer.

Build 59 causes 2 exceptions when I exit Windows. In fact, I have had this happen on all builds after 44, which shipped with my Gateway system.  Am I doing something wrong, or is this problem commonly overlooked? Bob Hofkin

Seen from a typographically point of view, ATM using PostScript fonts is better than TrueType; the hinting mechanism incorporated in PS is gorgeous. Multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in a PS font as problematically; they may have better use of the Unicode features of TT fonts (in Windows NT). I've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size PS fonts; I haven't seen those as TT fonts. Most of them are rendering quite inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts). Simply compare TimesNewRoman as a PS font with the TT font; the first looks better. I am hoping that there will be ATM/NT !  --  Claudius Mokler
Wondering if somebody could tell me if we can change the cluster size of my IDE drive.  Normally I can do it with Norton's Calibrat on MFM/RLL drives but dunno if I can on IDE too. glenn Jayaputera
Hi,  there were a couple of articles posted to this group the other day with the above subject heading.  Unfortunately, they expired  before I could read them.  I could really use an xterm-like thing     on my Amiga 4000; could somwone give me any information. Thanks, Larry R. Nittler

The second part is    posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about   system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in   comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are   included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three   sections of this document  before posting.              All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from   rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory    pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory   FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as   general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last   part of the group name followed by "-faq.Z", e.g the FAQ for   comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for   comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as    compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end   of  the file name when "getting" the file, rtfm will automatically    decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have    these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to    pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/"name"  in the body text where   "name" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.   general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the   subject "help" for more detailed instructions.          ====================   I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)  ====================           Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is    a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions   (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve   Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used   ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my   system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a   patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box   would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I   installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to   print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs.    P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.)            Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we   ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the   table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other   relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially   the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read   the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that   you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen   of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has   already made its way around the world three hundred times before,   and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any   newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself   with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup   news.announce.newusers.  HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1)                 comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,   a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists   for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ   lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and   comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part   will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are   available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the   pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this   document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named   as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by   "-faq", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is   stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use   either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command    to decompress it.  However if you leave off the ".Z" extension when    you "get" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file   before sending it to you.              This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned   newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ   lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to   get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere   else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand.    It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a   particular question or comment should be posted.  Please   familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh   newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear   in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong   where.              To jump to a particular question search for   section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For   example to find "Where can I FTP Macintosh software?" search for   the string  "(2.1)".  To jump to a section instead of a question   use a zero for  the question number.  WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)       comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of    frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup   comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are   worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list   covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup   comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and    available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in    /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list    for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from   rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now   is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently   asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,   telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has   compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of   questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform   conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp   from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim   Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX   environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux   and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at   jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.  WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)          There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones.    You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite   integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask   the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft   Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an   excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their   ways of  communicating.            Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your   mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too   :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering   silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one   that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of   Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a   question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,   normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question   to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered   by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few   network software designers.             Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post.    If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra   minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important   enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading.    For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a   catch-all newsgroup.             The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in   this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs   where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications   (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought   to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps   unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup.    Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases   all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions   about non-communications hardware including questions about what   software is necessary to make particular hardware work to   comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software   belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and   extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about   A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk   belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.             Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard.    Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development   environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit   questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,   comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the   netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer   are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking.              A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY   technical question about an application that actually begins to   delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent   example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly   compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)   might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.               For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to   comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We   understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to   get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to   buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and   religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is   too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is   Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not   specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.             Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the   comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions.    Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more   thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI   are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a   Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place   and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in   comp.sys.mac.  4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF  THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND  WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?       No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as   frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to   the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in   System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium   for answering common questions like this one.              You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail   response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it   before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups   covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that   lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the   section of this document that answers their question with just the   click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to   someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they   can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.       ===   FTP  (2.0)   ===  WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)       The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,   freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),   mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu   (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several   others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove   them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from   the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was   notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the   less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless   otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document   should be available at the above sites.           To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians    should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se   (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in    the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1).    Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),     ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1).    Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au   (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese   users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp   (130.69.254.254).           A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3).    This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,   developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things   that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material   at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other   sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple   system software.  Please read the various README documents   available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're   connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute   material you find here.  CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)       The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from   The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH   INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available   words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your   message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files   you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using   message with just the text "help" (no quotes).  WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)       If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above   sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it   an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject "help."    Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,   America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server   in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi   (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,   the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of   thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as "archie"   (no password is needed) and type "prog filename" to find what   you're looking for or type "help" for more detailed instructions.    For instance you would type "prog Disinfectant" to search for a   convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails   to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of   the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with "prog   Disinfectant", you might try "prog disi" instead.  Substring   searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many   erroneous matches add a ".*\.hqx" to the end of the substring, e.g.   "prog disi.*\.hqx"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in   .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does.           Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE   asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you   follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the   net where to find a particular piece of software.  CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)       No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from   comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please   refer to the first questions in this section to find out about   anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.  WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)       Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to   more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're   compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're   translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format   that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special   two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex   files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure   8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary   protocol.             How a file has been translated and compressed for   transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have   a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was   compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file   you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the   process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step   decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary   (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress   it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table   below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs   will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh   files as they are downloaded. *************************************************************************** Suffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar  Extractors -------------------------------------------------------------------------- StuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                   Compact Pro|         X     X  Packit     |                           X UUTool     |                                                      X  MacCompress|                                X  SunTar     |               X     X     X                                X  BinHex 5.0 |                     X  BinHex 4.0 |               X  DiskDoubler|                           X                X  UnZip      |                                                   X  DiskCopy   |                                     X  macutil    |         X     X           X                X ***************************************************************************      A few notes on the decompressors:       StuffIt is a family of products that use several different   compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff   all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,   StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will   not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0.    You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt   Expander.                StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller   archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow   maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep   net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous   ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.              UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX   formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)   respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac   products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators   that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also   available by anonymous ftp.              Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to   decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading   them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the   Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be   automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress   everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0   archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an   archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if   a program does what you need it to do before you download all of   it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the   info-mac/unix directory.      A few notes on the compression formats:       .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file   transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text.    Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal   stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications   programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating   MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance   they'll be downloading MacBinary files.          .image: This format is normally used only for system software,   so that on-line users can download files that can easily be   converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of   using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve   Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on   your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive.    MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have   some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.          .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above   table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created   with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be   capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some   unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard   designation for self-extracting archives created with their    payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they    append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)       By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human   being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a   university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to   give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo   Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,   dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt.    Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.               If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually   asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer    terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of    protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of   StuffIt from a local bulletin board system.              If you have religious objections to software gotten by any    means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that    you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by    far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and    login.  Type the word "binary."  Hit return.  Type "cd   mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression" and hit return.  Then   "get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin"  and hit return.  Of course   it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt   Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this   fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto   your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will   produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If   you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still   need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make   sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe   is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last   step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals   for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.         HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)        You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable   Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac   without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.   You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as   Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may    terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement    since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going    to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.     (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send    your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering   your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world    of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question   again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh   programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a    Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs. ================================================================= TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0) =================================================================           While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific   problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here.    These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking   for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step   preventative maintenance routine described in section four,   especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system   heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your   problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to   recommend solutions to you.  IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)       "Microsoft Word is crashing" doesn't say much.  What were you   doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the   crash?  The more information you provide about the actions   preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you.    The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions   preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the   following steps fix the problem.  For example, "Sometimes   QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error." is   not nearly as helpful as "QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two   text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already   contain text."  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug   remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the   problem and see if it's still there or not.  READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)       Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and   bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the   manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound   familiar.  CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)       Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus   infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and   they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.  REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)              For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,   improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file   on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This   can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring   from original masters will normally fix this.  REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)         Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file   than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous.    See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean   reinstall.              If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these   steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your   application and some other software or a genuine bug in the   program.  So it's time to  ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)              You need to find the minimal system on which the problem   will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the   cause of a system or application crash:         a.	Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do      conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself      without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin      launching other applications until you find the one that causes       the crash.            b.	If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're      running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you       can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially       when performing complicated operations.            c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit      addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile      software out there including some from companies that really       have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?        I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its       incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.            d.	Boot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears      you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove      extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense      when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs      when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the      Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the      problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,      either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have      a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the      extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the      most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the      conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the      offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make       sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.  CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)       By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why   the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the   software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work   around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the   bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.       ======================   PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)  ======================       You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a   tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot   of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to   charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's   no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step   program should be performed about every three months.   TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)       Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more   smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a   little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,   you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for   applications you no longer have, archives of software you've   dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements   for events that have come and gone and many other files you no   longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several   more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty    the trash.  RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)       Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain.    Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension    in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an   extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably   better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes   up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup.    For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no   need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your   extension habit can really help avoid crashes.   REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)       The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary   to associate each file with the application that created it.  It   lets the system know what application should be launched when you   open a given file and what icons it should display where.    Depending on its size each application has one or more   representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files   move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become   bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac.    Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with   a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than   to defeat an incumbent.              One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments   you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice   Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments   across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only    if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed.              To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your   extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys.    You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild   the desktop and warning you that "This could take a few minutes."    Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you   have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may   want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.               If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing   preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's   freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the   Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly   corrupt data structures.      ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)       All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950   contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain   settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk   such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this "parameter   RAM" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset   it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys   while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,   Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the   Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter   RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General   Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.              The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the    date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is   notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this   opportunity to reset it anyway.  RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5)        Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most   people still have at least half a row of icons march across the   bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these   extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of   memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough   to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of   it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,   knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and   trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this   fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance   and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.             If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically   resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6   it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage   all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set   to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all.    The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot   blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility   BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks   how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much   needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,   use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.  REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)       System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if   you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them.    Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file   corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:     1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.       2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out          of your System file into a temporary suitcase.     3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the          Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple          extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be          replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or          installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions,          Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level          of the System Folder.     4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder          is  fine.     5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then          choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your          model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead,          but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't          need that waste your memory and disk space.     6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the          temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System          folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you          forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace          things individually until you find the duplicate piece.      7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.     8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file          that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable          system overall.      DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)       Much like system files hard disks have data structures that   occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even   causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility   for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System   disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in   the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier    version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com   and run it on all your hard disks.                Several companies have released payware disk utilities that   detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid   though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything   that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general   work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's   Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh   2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well   as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do.    For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of   Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features   and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.              All of these products occasionally encounter problems they   can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and   reformat (4.9).      BACKING UP  (4.8)       This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be   done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back   up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies   or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate   from your application and support files then it's easy to only back   up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three   months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk.              A number of programs are available to make backing up   easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with   System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup   utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder   onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the   Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup   utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.             Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network   server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should   check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,   doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There   are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD   Backup from System 6.    DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)       As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free   space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the   operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be   stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more   and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several   ways to defragment a hard disk.             The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your   files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while   you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.              A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for   the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.   without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag   about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the   shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before   defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO   freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the   net by asking for one.   REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)       Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a   hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't   need to reformat every three months; but when your system is   crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means   of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even   gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are   created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate   mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3   megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may   vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator   of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not   to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.                Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to   initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software.    Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal   disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY.    Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with   their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat   your hard disk.             A number of general-purpose formatters are also available   which go beyond the bundled software to include features like   encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk   access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the   best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition   ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware   formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones   bundled with your hard disk.              PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and   processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter   what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and   data losses are a very good possibility.      Elliotte Rusty Harold         Department of Mathematics
Does anyone out there know how to add an additional internal hard-drive to a mac IIsi. NOT to replace the already existing hardrive! I was think of hooking to internal drive together or any other ways to add internal harddrive beside replacement. I just don't wanadd an external harddrive. I'm open to any suggestions..please response to the address below. thanks

Hi peeps, Here's another of those "any ideas" type queries. I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy, without a keyboard.  But no problem so far. When I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc. Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of. The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines. The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to CGA - but useful for my laptop). Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors? I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway? A UK support dealer said "Circuit diagrams? Sync?" So any ideas. John. ____________________________________________________________________ Quote:       Computer Scientists are not boring.

A friend of mine recently acquired an 8!24 GC card for his IIsi and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white. I know there have been numerous reports about the worth of the GC, but I was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little more on the subject.  Any replies encouraged.  Thanks in ad- vance.

Subject: [Q] Internal modems without uart ? Seeing all these questions about uart types, their availability, and their relative merits, wouldn't it be fine, if for internal highspeed modems there were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and instead accessing directly the relatively large send/receive buffers of the   modem, thus eliminating all problems with interrupt latencies ? Just an idea, Computing Centre, Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany.

Contents:     lets you use Drag and Drop to create an OPEN LOOK application with     XView, OLIT, UIT or TNT.  Very easy to use.     there _might_ be an OLIT port of this UI builder.     one of the first third-party GUI builders to support OPEN LOOK,     using the XView toolkit.  It was reviewed in SunExpert magazine     in 1990.     uib is a user interface builder which supports building applications     that support both OPEN LOOK and Motif.	It generates code for     ParcPlace's OI C++ toolkit and can make use of user created     subclasses.  Note: `OI' can also display an OSF/Motif GUI at runtime.     Uses X resources to specify an Xt widget hierarchy and actions to     user-defined callbacks.  uses OLIT, Xt or Motif.     Lets you write code to a common subset of OPEN LOOK, Motif, Microsoft     Windows, the Macintosh GUI, and even terminals (using curses).  You buy     an XVT toolkit for each environment.

Uses OLIT.     BUG: can also use OSF/Motif and Athena widgets. contact: Scott Oaks Description:     Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the     `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the     currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can     move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This     lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around     from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm.     Hypertext package written entirely in NeWS.  Runtime from turing.com     in /pub or ftp.uu.net (graphics/NeWS/HyperLook1.5-runtime.tar.Z) Maestro (ftp from sioux.stanford.edu)     Multimedia authoring tools, including support for sound, text & video. xvnews (ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu)     An xview-based newsreader for netnews.

Antialiasing support - with colour OpenWindows 3 try pageview -aa -dpi 150     Note that pageview uses the X11/NeWS server to interpret the PostScript,     and thus won't run on an X terminal or other non-OpenWindows server.     It's *not* enough to be runing an OPEN LOOK UI [tm] window manager such     as olwm. Notes:     Only runs under OpenWindows 2. 	simple interface to NeWS and the OpenWindows server Notes:     Crispin Goswell's PostScript interpreter, much hacked.     Not OPEN LOOK compliant.  No Type 1 font support.     There are other versions of this called `xps', `postscript', etc.;     don't confuse this `xps' with the one mentioned above. (from the Free Software Foundation)     Supports Type 1 fonts.  Not OPEN LOOK based. Notes:     These are included in the XView source distribution from     export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib; they're also included with Sun's     OpenWindows. Notes:     A version of Xterm with an OPEN LOOK UI, print interface,     ANSI X3.64 colour escape sequences, etc. Notes:     An OLIT-based terminal emulator.  I couldn't get the demo version to     give me a shell prompt, although it did look like it was a pretty fll     vt340 emulation, with double-height characters, colour, fonts, grahics     and so forth.     With the Union Flag (the British flag) as their logo I somehow expected     an English address, perhaps in Bristol...     Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,     which lists over 200 pages of applications.     You can also get the free CDWare CD/ROM, which contains demo versions     of several popular OPEN LOOK UI applications.  Once you've done this,     you can often simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license     upgraded from demo, and receive the full product documentation.

Ada bindings for XView     Sun Ada 1.1 includes among other things an Ada Source Code Generator     for Devguide.  It uses the Verdix XView Ada bindings.     It does not yet [July 1992] support gfm (the guide file manager). C++ Bindings for XView Qualix's XV++. UIT     others: none so far... There are said (by Sun) to be two or three ports of OpenWindows either available now or in progress.  Contact Anthony Flynn at Open Vistas said 35, but perhaps they meant 3.5) OpenWindows source is available - commercially, it costs about $5,000 for the server, including TypeScaler and the toolkits; deskset (filemgr etc) is another $25,000; ToolTalk is $40,000 or so. Notes:     The libraries and utilities (olwm, cmdtool, etc) are available for     anonymous ftp from encyclo.jax.org. I used gcc 2.1 to compile the     sources. If there is enough interest, I can make the diffs     available. Notes:     Let me stress that this is *not* fully tested, but seems to work     pretty well.  Please let me know about any problems you find.     Problems I already know about: 	Large buttons under *any* non-Sun X server (non-xnews; i.e. any 	standard MIT X11R[45] server) have the bottom of the button 	chopped off.  We're working on this one. :-)     XView 3 is also available on the DEC Freeware CD, from DECUS. [actually this seems *not* to be Dave Scott's port; please accept my apologies  for listing this incorrectly.  A correct entry will appear as soon as I get  the necessary information.  -- Lee] Porter: (?) Notes:     Includes HP 720 build, HP XView patch file, Xvgr. Notes:     His patches were for Esix 4.0.3 but should work on DELL, ISC and Intel     SVR4 with no worries. The files are README.xview3 and xview3.diff.Z. Notes:     There is still a problem with tty support for the RS/6000. For     instance, the cmdtool will not work. Still, most everything else works.     For those of you who have already installed my previous patch, I have     put a separate patch for just the shared library problem. This file is     contrib/xview3/Fixes/xview3_rs6k_XView_lib.patch.Z. Notes:     Inlcudes olvwm, UIT Notes: In general, there is no point in using XView 2 if you have XView 3 available; it's a good idea to look for an XView 3 port first.  Moving from XView 2 to XView 3 is usually simply a matter of recompiling, unless you've done "dirty tricks" or used undocumented calls. Notes:     Stardent is now Kubota Pacific (KPC) Porter: (?) Notes:     A company called TGV makes a product called "XView for VMS".     They made XView 2.0 libraries.  I haven't seen them advertising     XView 3.0 libraries yet. Free:        an OPEN LOOK PacMan(tm) surrogate that     appears as a debugger - the bad guys are code bugs that     move around your screen; you (the good guy) chase them     with a 19" monitor that eats bugs.     A patience-style card game with two packs of cards and     excellent bitmap cards.     I suggest recompiling to allow the cards to have rounded edges.

        I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three  LC IIs, a Mac Plus with 45 MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX. My  problem? The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace.         These LC IIs have 4 MB RAM, 256K VRAM, and a Quantum LP105S HD  installed. I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit 1.3, and  it gives a very respectable 2.9 overall rating to this drive, so it's not  the drive. I have reinstalled System 7.1, MS-Word 5.1a, MS-Works 3.0, and  so on, all from the master disks. In short, I have done everything I can  think of in software. I am *not* a hardware hacker, though I pop cases  fairly often. But nothing works.         The problem is intermittent and unpredictable. The mouse always  moves smoothly, floppies always run at the same speed, but occasionally,  for about 1-2 hours at a time, a machine will run like it was running on  a 4 MHz 68000, not a 16 MHz 68030. It is VERY frustrating and makes it  nearly unusable. It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity.         Has anyone encountered this problem before? Has anyone got any  ideas? They would be much appreciated.                                     -- Andrew Geweke --- The Firing Squad BBS, public access Usenet mail and news.  +1 612 291 2632 Saint Paul, Minnesota
How do you solve the problem when the message "Cannot perform malloc" shows for XtCreateManagedWidget call? I have the application written in X11R5 running on DECstation using Athena widgets.  As soon as I added codes to do Remote Procedure Call, the program refused to work.  I also have my program working using just Xlib calls with RPC.

Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey's Mac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it, offering clean 32-bit ROM code (liberating his IIx from the virtual memory nightmare caused by Apple's 32-bit System Enabler). Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  Is it okay for a remanufacturer to resell only ROM chips from used machines?  I know that copies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to resell the original used ROM.  (After all, reselling a used computer involves the sale of the ROM anyway, so what's the difference?). Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would be a reasonably price to offer?  /\/\   Morgan Davis Group (619/670-0563)

I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3, but when I insert that card into my DOS 5.02 PC, it shows up as COM3, with IRQ3 and COM4's address (2E8)! When I get into debug, and dump the data at 40:0, it shows the address 2E8 as belonging to COM3 - even though the modem should be at COM4. Now, I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4, 2E8, IRQ3. To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC, I have to configure the modem as COM3, 2E8, IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that allows that, the FAX program that came with the modem does not work. Anyway, I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set, as COM4... I did run a few diagnostic programs, and they did not help at all: a few displayed the modem as COM4, and others displayed it as being COM3. I am not using Windows, this is just a DOS problem...Any help or pointers appreciated.... For various reasons, I must have this modem work at COM4, thus switching COM ports is not an answer... (Last time I posted this, I did not get any DOS specific answer, this time I have included all the specific information....please help!) ----- Avinash Chopde --  Avinash Chopde
** I am posting this for a friend ** I'm working on an application where we are creating a dither pattern  and rendering it in a window by applying it to the stipple pattern  of the GC.  The following code segment almost works if the window width  is an even multiple of 8.  If it is not an even multiple it skews the  pattern towards the right.  Another problem, whether it is an even  multiple of 8 or not, is a series of vertical lines spaced 8 pixels  apart. extern	Display	       *dpy; extern	Window		xid; extern	GC		gc; extern	int	Max_X, Max_Y;		/* set in resize handler	*/ dither(pixels) 	char	*pixels;		/* dither pattern data		*/ 	{ 	char	*bm;			/* bitmap data			*/ 	char    *bmp; 	long	 I, arraymax; 	arraymax = Max_X*Max_Y; 	bm  = (char *)malloc(arraymax); 	bmp = bm; 	for (I=j=0; I<arraymax; I++) 		{ 		if (pixels[I] & DITHER_BIT) 			*bmp |=   2<<j;		/* pixel on		*/ 		else 			*bmp &= ~(2<<j);	/* pixel off		*/ 		if (++j > 7) 			{ 			bmp++; 			j = 0; 			} 		} 	stipple = XCreateBitmapFromData(dpy, xid, bm, Max_X, Max_Y); 	free(bm); 	XClearWindow(dpy, xid); 	XSetStipple(dpy, gc, stipple); 	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillStippled); 	XFillRectangle(dpy, xid, gc, 0, 0, Max_X, Max_Y); 	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillSolid); 	} I suspect the answer is to pad the data. -- Mike Vaughn Sonatech

The Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) documentation (blurb) states that the user must separately acquire the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), which contains the Windows tools to build the drivers. If we are using Borland C++ with Application Frameworks, is this necessary? We also have a copy of the Microsoft Press Programmer's Reference Library (books) which normally comes with the SDK, and Microsoft Macro Assembler 6.0. Why is the SDK neccessary for development of Virtual Device Drivers?  - Steven Murray     (posted on behalf of Brian Davies)

It's pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris 610 on the basis of problems with one machine.  Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII doesn't make a lot of sense either.  If this person is so convinced the 610 is buggy have they talked to Apple about it or are they just assuming it's a problem with all of them? -Terry

I can imaging that they are getting hard to sell, given that   1. a C610 is way faster, and is comparable in price.  2. an LCIII is about the same speed, and is way cheaper. So your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people that IIvx's are a much better buy than a C610 just so he can get rid of all his old stock!

Just create the window in the place you want it and set the program position field in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property, then map it. Then, assuming they have a non brain dead window manager, the user can say whether they want to us program specified positions or not. For tvtwm the UsePPosition command in the .tvtwmrc will do this. Now, I'm sure that by the time this message gets out of our local news timewarp someone will have advised you to set the user position bit in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS. _Do_not_ do this. It's evil. It's a disservice to your users. Offler the tusked crocodile god will come in the night and remove your vital organs with a blunt spoon if you even contemplate it. -- 					 |<
I've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to execute a DOS program from Windows, either thru the Program Manager or the File Manager. A message box comes up and says "This program or one of its components is compressed. Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand the file." Now, I know this is bogus, because I can always execute the program from DOS when not running windows. The program in question is COMMAND.COM (yup, the basic DOS command line shell...) And, the expand command tells me that the file is already expanded. All my windows apps work just fine - I only get this message when trying to execute a DOS program from Windows.
Hi everybody out there, I just got the third beta release disk (march 93) of WindowsNT and still am not able to boot up that system. The final step achieved is the display of IO-error 0x0069. But, since this is the beta release of the SDK for NT and not of NT, Microsoft does not include a manual on the OS itself, explaining what this error means of what I can do to get rid of. My configuration is:  Mainboard     Hauppauge 4860-25, rev.

ET4000 graphics card, 1Meg (ColorImage5) The system is running fine under DOS and Windows 3.1 etc, but trying to do the setup for NT, - automatic setup does not recognize controller (AHA1542-compat.)   when adding manually, NT complains not finging any CD-ROM drive - the manual setup (WINNT) does not copy everything from CD to HD,   does not recognize controller, but takes it manually.   Setup continues until it tries to boot. Then it starts loading   several stuff from disk (seems to fing the HD), but messing up   with that damned IO-Error 69. I took away all IO cards not essential, but that did not make any effect. Anybody got any ideas? Help would be greatly appreciated. Institute of Optics Tech. Univ. Berlin, Germany

First get ghostscript and check out the gs_2asc.ps file that comes with it. It prints out some information about where each text string goes on the page, and maintains page counts.

I have a 486 DX 33 motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up.  I'd rather not replace the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know if i can use a DX/2 66Mhz cpu. The BIOS is late model AMI, circa 1991, and the system crystal is approx 66.3Mhz.  My question is, can i just replace the original 33MHz cpu with the new DX/2 cpu? If its possible, will there be a need for extra cooling devices such as heatsinks and / or muffin fans?? Mike

X] X.SH DESCRIPTION XThe  X.B rx Xprogram connect to the specified X.I host Xand executes the specified X.I command Xin the background, returning immediately.  To allow the execution Xof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to Xthe remote session.  If you omit X.IR command , Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The X.B rxterm Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes X.I args Xto the remote xterm as arguments. X.PP XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local Xmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote Xmachine. X.PP XIf the name of the file from which X.B rx Xis executed is anything other than ``rx,'' X.B rx Xtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command Xto run on the remote host, using any X.I command Xparameters as arguments for the remote command. X.PP XIf X.B rx Xthinks you are using X.B xauth Xbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or Xto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization Xkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use X.B xhost(1) Xto grant access to the remote host. X.SH OPTIONS X.TP X.BI \-l " username" XUse X.I username Xas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence Xof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username. X X.SH ENVIRONMENT XIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR, XXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the Xremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which Xcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the Xvariable RXENV. X.PP XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified Xa hostname as is needed. X.SH DIAGNOSTICS X.TP X.IB command ": don't recognise my name." X.B rx Xcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case Xit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal. X.TP X.B "rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...]" XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it. X.SH AUTHOR X.br XOriginally based on a program with the same name from the X.B gwm Xdistribution.  To distinguish this "rx" from other programs Xwith similar names, you should refer to this program as the X.B Glasgow X.BR rx . X.SH "SEE ALSO" XX(1), rsh(1), xterm(1), xauth(1), xhost(1), gwm(1) X.SH BUGS X.B Rx Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the Xlocal user, and the remote one, depending on whether the remote Xhost is onsite or not, and whether an alternative username was used Xor not. X.PP XIn particular, if either the locally used shell, or the remotely Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell, X.B sh(1) Xthen strange things are more likely to happen.  Especially when  Xit's only one of them. X.PP XSometimes quoting can get messed up. X.PP XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in X.B rx Xto make it believe something that is not true, and fail because of it. X.PP XWhen X.B rx Xuses X.B xhost Xto grant access, the X.B xhost Xcommand may fail silently. X.PP XIf X.B rx Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine, it will Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh.  If this happens, you Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment.

At the same time, I try to make as few assumptions as possible X#  about the remote machine.  Here's a list of all the more tricky ones... X# *) That the remote machine has csh.  (Linux?) X# *) That $RSHELL = /bin/(k)?sh ==> remote shell = /bin/(k)?sh.  (Make same.) X# *) If remote shell = sh, that $PATH is compatible.  (Use csh, etc..)

X############################################################################## X# Why am I using csh to run the remote commands?

Hi Netters, 	Having inherited a Solbourne (S-4000 : Sun 4 Compatible), I was wondering if somebody has ported X11R5 to this beast. Since Solbournce Computer Inc. folded up I don't know where I can get the kernel to move from R4. Since they never joined the MIT Consortium, the regular distribution doesn't work.

What is the real story here? Can I hook up any PC SVGA Montitor to the Centris internal video? Do I need to make my own cable if it doesn't not come with one? Has apple released a Tech note with the pinouts for doing such? The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower than that of their mac counterparts... --mike **************************     having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes.  at least for the 600x400 configuration.  you can get an adaptor called Mac VGA -Q from James engineering (510) 525 7350 and this will let you display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable.  I think the 800x600 requires 56Khz horizontal sync.  I use this on my sony 1604.  (gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor. hope it helps                                                                     -A.

:  : Hey, :  : I'm about to purchase a DAT drive.  Does anyone know which mail order vendors : offer DAT drives with HP's mechanism?  What other mechanism is available out : there?  Good, bad points? 	We bought one from Relax technologies.  BIG mistake.  The drive had some jumpers set incorrectly so it didn't work at first, and the software they shipped with it was incompatable with the drive (it was the new compression model), and worst of all, when I opened the drive up to fiddle with the jumpers, I found the inside of the case COVERED WITH METAL FILINGS!!! Sorry to shout.  Apparently when they drilled the mounting holes in the case they forgot to clean it before putting the drive in.  This was a HP drive, by the way, and is now working fine (knock on wood), no thanks to Relax technologies. Hey, your mileage may vary, but let me suggest that you NOT buy from Relax Technologies, even though their prices are usually about the lowest. --Dave ============================================================================== Dave Schwarze  "Opinions expressed are just that" ==============================================================================

I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes and collects data from that nodes periodically. I need to display this data on my X Application. I tried to invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works ok. But the problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. So I doesn't returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe. I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may be able to clarify. 1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !!    Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork    my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How    should I call this processes.? 2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more    than one servers input.

I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ, but I cannot fix it. The XKeysymDB-file is at the right location and it works fine under SunOS.

Now look in the system.ini file and if any of them say device=xxxxxxx.386 than change it to  device=*xxxxxxx Thats should work. Was your system.ini file erased for some reason?

Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information is associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_ a parameter to the drawing routines. So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2); XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4); for this effect. This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters like line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every drawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint() if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers there are Image routines. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+
I am planning to convert my Motif 1.2 app from pixel to font units which would all be set in the app's resource file instead of hard coded in the program. However, the word here is from people who tried this already that for some unknown reason XmForm offsets placed in the resource file are still interpreted in pixel units forcing people to code those offset font units into the program. Can somebody confirm this? Thanks, Joe Pannon

I am running windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode.  The sound card I have is the ATI Stereo F/X-CD sound card which claims Adlib and Soundblaster compatibility. Using Windows MediaPlayer, I can play the midi files that came with my sound card.  However, I can't play any of the midi files that belong to the WinJammer midi editor that I ftp'd from cica.  I also can't play any midi files I generate with muzika (also from cica).  When I try to play the files, a dialog box pops up saying that the music may not play right, and it has a checkbox asking me if i wish to disable this message in the future. Is this normal, or do I have something set wrong?  I would really like to be able to write music on muzika and have my computer play it. I also ftp'd the game dare2dream for windows (from cica) and its music won't play either - I get the same dialog box. The MIDI Mappers that I have are ATI Ext MIDI, ATI OPL3 MIDI, and Vanilla. I have tried using all three. Any help, suggestions, shoulders to cry on, etc. would be appreciated very much. John P. --  ___________________ John Punshon       |

I also think that anyone using Windows 3.1 without 8 megs of RAM, a 386-40, and 200 megs of hard drive space, is beating their head against a wall.  Those are also legitimate requirements for OS/2.  In fact, the requirements  for Windows 3.1 and OS/2 are about equal.      --  |          "The natural progress of things is for government             | |              to gain ground and for liberty to yield"                  | |                           Thomas Jefferson                             |

Go to Radio Shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound. It comes in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap.  At Radio Shack, it's catalog number 276-1372.  It's a mix of silicone and zinc oxide, and conducts heat very well.  Plus, it's tacky. Usually, you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink, and then bolt or clamp the sink down, but if you don't move your Mac, gravity and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold things in place.  Just make sure you remember it's in there, in case you tilt your Mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose.  You wouldn't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your Mac.

I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426  chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu  (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so. From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons  (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the  following for the sake of comparison: 							Wintach              		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65 Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of  the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review. Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the  DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120  drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s,  I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at  least that was what the program said. Oliver Weatherbee

	Three q's: 1) is it reliable? 2) how does it send the information from a MS Windows app over the X11 protocol? Does it just draw everything as graphics into one window, or does it use multiple windows and essentially work more cleverly? 3) If I want to run MS Word, for example, remotely, do I have to run a separate copy of MS Windows remotely, and then start MS Word from that, or can MS Word be started remotely on its own?

After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos and windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple of different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  I have,  however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY do what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but OS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  I have heard that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew where to obtain a copy.  I would appreciate any information, as I would like,  once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs. ->Robbie<- z_shererrg.sfasu.edu

I purchased 2x8 MB 72-pin (60 ns) SIMMs for my Quadra 800 from Chip Merchant (I've been very satisfied with them in the past).  Either one alone works, but both together fail.  I called Apple for advice and was told that there was a problem with "Composite" SIMMs.  Only non-composite SIMMs should be used with the Q-800.  Chip Merchant confirmed that they presently sell only composite 72-pin SIMMs.  So, Q-800 SIMMs need to be both 60 ns and non-composite.

I am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse cursor enters a window in my application.  I'm using InterViews, but that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in X. For example, I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2, with point-to-focus set, and that generally works, but not always, depending on what was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell tool window to another.  Or so it seems... My question, then, is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to- focus within my application?  Thanks for any response. Dave
Since loading Windows, two of my DOS applications have been acting strangely.  It appears that font changes and page orientation changes (so far) are not being recognized in WordPerfect/DOS and QuattroPro/DOS.  Another DOS application does accept font and page orientation changes, so I don't think the problem is with the printer. I reloaded QuattroPro, and these changes are still not accepted whether launching from Windows or the DOS prompt. Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look or how to correct this problem?  I've ordered QuattroPro for Windows, but need a landscape application printed immediately.  Please e-mail.

The MCP-cards are NuBUS cards with a Motorola 68000-Processor and 512 KB RAM (expandable to 1 Meg). MCP is a development platform for hardware-designers so they can use a card with an own processor and thus the main processor isn't needed for these cards.

Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to "print to a file", with output as a Postscript file.  Later, I would like to take this Postscript file to a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the document at 600 dots per inch resolution. I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from an image processing program that can output images in Postscript. Here's the problem:  the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv) doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  In fact, the setup dialog for this driver does have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the menu is 300!  Not a really useful menu. Any ideas?

My recently modified Quadra 700 with a socket for clock oscillators has now completed nearly 40 hours of error free operation at 32 mhz (with a 64 mhz clock oscillator). I have also tried a 55 mhz CMOS clock and that works as well. On the more stupid side, I've discovered you can use a 40 mhz clock and make your Q700 as slow as a Centris 610. However, a 25 mhz clock which would have yielded a 12.5 mhz Quadra 700 (Who'd want one?) didn't work at all. Impatiently awaiting a 66 mhz clock,        
I read in a recent Tidbits(171-2?) about the possibility of putting a 68030 in a PB100. I am interested in doing so, but would like to know more about it. Does it involve just replacing the 68000 that is on the daughterboard, or does it involve getting a new daughter- board. Also, would the 68030 be able to run QT with the PB100's screen(not pretty I know, but possible?) And of course, what would the damage be ($). Any info would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Hi, there! I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD300. I've been told, however, that: 1. The double speed of CD300 is achievable only on machines    with SCSI-2. 2. The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession    capability, which I need. 3. Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD150. Any comments?

The 33 MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about $500 (still not a bad deal).  I believe the Powercard is one generation  older than the Universal Powercache, and the one primary difference is that the Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many Macs with the proper adaptor.  Both cards are 68030 based. I'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise  different from the Powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me?).

I have a question for y'all: I'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolis in the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions in IBM PC magazines) Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface, but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second, *max*. How can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it had to have a DTR of 10megs a second? (I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache. I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data at 5megs a second!) Thank you.

I have a mac plus with 2.5MB RAM. I have just bought an extra 2MB so that I can have the max 4MB RAM that a plus supports. However, I can't get it to boot after I install the 2 extra SIMMs. Instead I get a sad mac (Sorry, but I can't remember the code). Looking at the motherboard, I can see that 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says "256Kb path - 1 row". I assume that was done when the first 1MB SIMMs were added. So, my question is: Are there any other resistors that need snipping?  				or, Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged? Any and all advice will be appreciated. Chris Gatenby

The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at : 76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate : and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't : handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly. I don't know which tube the Viewsonic 17 uses, but it has an 82khz horizontal bandwidth so you can go pretty high.  I ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which was as fast as the Orchid P9000 could drive it.  Also, the 17 does claim to be able to support 1600x1280, but I have no experience with that. Since I have the spec sheet in front of me I'll type some in: CRT:	17", 0.28 mm dot pitch, 90 deg deflection, RGB mediou short 	persisance, Tint (TM=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflection 	horizontal freq: 30-82Khz, vertical freq: 50-90Hz compatibility: PC from VGA to 1600x1280 non-interlaced, mac IIci and above controls: contrast, brightness, position, size, degauss, p-p voltage, color 	temp, sync select, color tuning, moire on/off. video band witdth: 135 MHz Max brightness: 120 cd/m2 at white flat field misconvergence: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner dimensions: 16.3"x16.22"x17.64", weight 42.6 lbs I don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, I just  typed them in.  Other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple dynamic astigmatism focus'.  Right.  They mean they use two lenses.  Advanced Invar shadow mask.  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green, and blue.  How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me. But beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at.  Sharp, clear, and isn't nearly as bad as the NEC's for reflections. geoff sherwood

>Yes, I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on. But what about >monitors? They generate a lots of heat. Should I or shouldn't I keep them on >24 hours a day? Any advice? Thanks. Take care...Paul I vote for turning them off at night.  THe stress of off/on is a little  harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but turning them off for 4-5 hours or overnight is a good idea. The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along with heat.  We have a lot of 10-year old machines in the basement that still work, but who cares?

I have a Headland Technologies Video Seven VRAMII board that only came with 512K, at the time this was ok but... I need info or help with upgrading this board to 1 Mbyte.  There are 2 rows of pins over the VRAM chips, I think for a piggyback board of VRAM.  I would like to hear from anyone that may be able to help me upgrade this board.  Maybe someone from Headland who maybe read- ing this has one of these piggyback boards just laying around, please please please! Does anyone know of where I could maybe buy the upgrade for this?  I would sure love to use this in 800X600-256 color mode but for the time being, I can only get 3/4 of the screen with the bottom part a white strip, obviously because of the missing VRAM, actually I'm surprised it even works to this degree at all! As a last resort, I will wind up selling this board :^( and probably be getting a 1 Mb-ET4000 based "dumb frame buffer".  This VRAMII was Editors Choice in the 9/24/91 PC Mag.  So if anyone has any info, please email or as a last resort post to this group.  Thanks in advance.

I have the following problem on a Dell 450SE with the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro  EISA: When I start Windows, the first 5 times I try to run an application, it does not start. Windows will show the following error message:    Error Executing application. There is not enough memory to run the        application. After the first 5 tries, the application I want to run will start, and  afterwards there are no more problems. When I change the Video driver from  Mach 32 to 8514/a, this problem does not occur, so I suspect the ATI  drivers (I tried both the build 55 and build 59 driver).

I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when it is released though it'll be in limited quantities, I think they have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out a bit later).   Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal frequency right?), you're gonna love the 2 megs version.  It can do 1280x1024x256 at 75Hz, 1152x900x256 at 80Hz, 1024x768x256 at 90Hz(!), 1024x768x65536 at 75Hz.  It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and 800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth  monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor, otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)   If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the video sig.

I know that there is a list of the best shareware and public domain programs for Windows at the cica ftp site, but unfortunately it is a year old.

Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a bargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies (a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime player in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign).

Last night I tried to reinstall the utilities from the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit disk. The setup program appeared to run perfectly normally, but when it had finished, there was no Program Group created. Now, I know I've done this before successfully, and creating a group myself didn't exactly tax me, but I'm curious as to what might be going on. I can only assume that something left over from the last time I had it installed is getting in  the way, but I can't figure out what.

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1). The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike in the major version number, is:   o undo has been implemented.     By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is     provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,     levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is     supported. There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)                           -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of what it is all about: aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it features, amongst other things,    o multiple windows    o multiple buffers    o default menu interface    o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons       under user control    o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters    o provision for defining a keyboard macro    o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters    o file selection via a browser    o knowledge of line numbers    o parenthesis matching    o regular expression searching    o restricted or unlimited undo    o ability to change font    o easy entry of control codes    o xterm-like keymap feature    o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)    o both brief and comprehensive on-line help    o server mode with cooperating client programs    o optional extension language using Tcl    o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability    o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and Xaw3d options, on the following systems:    Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5    Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5    Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5    DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5    HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5    MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5     but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first. A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is provided for those systems that do not have one. Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release, 2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2 never got converted to make use of it. aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due course from several other ftp sites.

I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets:                        callbacks and actions The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code that performs a lot of drawing into a window. I want to connect this to a widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards. But because the drawing takes some while, I want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was interrupted. It seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can I give the user the impression that his inputs are immediately processed ? Has anybody an idea? Please answer via e-mail. Thanks in advance.

My 486DX2-50 has 8MB of 70ns RAM and a Trident SVGA card. Sometimes I feel it runs very slowly, especially when running Windows. I'm planning to buy an ATI Graphic Ultra + next semester. Is that all I need to get the problem solved? Is 70ns RAM chips too slow for my machine? Do faster RAM chips make a big difference? I use CAD software on my computer as well. Do those up-grades good enough to speed it up a lot? Any one experienced the difference between ISA bus and VL bus(both with a graphic accelerator)? (A SCSI controller may not be appropriate, since I may have to replace my hard disks as well. However, sometimes I do have huge files on my computer. Does it really worth to use a SCSI interface? I can't spend too much on  it) t he ) Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance. Dennis p.s. Man! I hate the stupid text editor. Is there any way I can type my article in a DOS word-processor and load the file into usenet? Thanks in advance again!

Using the software you're using, I agree with you there.  What I did: I installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same as your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the  DOS "backup" command on just that much.  To restore, I boot to the  "system" diskette, and use DOS "restore" to read in that much, then boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your case), overwriting what I've just restored.

Here's the situation: At home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.  At work, I have windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word.  So, I configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file, which I then bring to work. My question:  how do I print this postscript file through the print manager at work? If, for example, I select print from the file manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me several pages of postscript gibberish. I know that I can open a DOS window and do: 	 copy file.ps com1: which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds. There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print Manager, but if there is, I can't find any mention of it in the documentation. Anyone know how to do this? --  Michael Clase Memorial University of Newfoundland

I've got a 386DX-40, 4MB and I'm using Windows 3.1. Sometimes I wondered why  Windows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing (execpt having lunch or something like that). Then I turned this virtual memory swapfile off, and Windows became quite faster, but now having less memory free. And so I'm still wondering, why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the convertional is sufficient? Any common-sense-explanation is really appreciated.   
We are having a problem with a Quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-) This Quadra is 'stuffed' with 64Mb RAM, 2Mb VRAM and some large disk (400Mb I think). What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the Mac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications, even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's pretty hard to hit menu items ;-) We had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the cache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU right?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did not keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it, but did it twice within an hour yesterday). The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway). These included: -swapping the RAM -swapping the VRAM -swapping monitors (3 different 13" Apple RGB and 2 16" Apple RGB) -swapping cables -disconnecting HD and booting from floppy -sacrificing various small mammals Here are some other facts: -when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed  (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out) -the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards  that exhibit it in our lab -Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards  that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as  faulty according to us. Here are some speculations: -I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that  much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do  with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can  reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring). -the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our  walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We  have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in  the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do  not want to believe it. -it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past  security at the entrance to our site. Has anyone any ideas? Please? Please email as well as posting cause I seem to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less time available to read news! :-) Thank you in advance.

Hello Net.People, We have a LaserWriter Select 310 (standard 1.5Mb RAM) connected to an LC III (4/80). The print driver cannot find any Adobe Type 1 fonts or any TrueType fonts in the System. The connections to the printer and the Driver installation are correct but this 310 printer still refuses to find fonts and work correctly out of the box. IMHO, an Apple product not working out of the box is a shameful event. The installer disks for the printer install: LW Select 310 driver v 1.0, PrintMonitor v 7.1 and backgrounder v 3.1 (!) on a System 7.1 LC III. Has anyone else had similar experiences with this printer/configuration, because we really need some help on this one. Thanks,

              Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists               ---------------------------------------------        Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful    information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET    newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly,    there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum    for SCO products in general.        With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO    newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been    active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt    that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*    hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.    biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in    accordance with accepted procedure within "biz".  Given the content,    this change relocated the "opendesktop" newsgroup to a more proper place    within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new "announce"    became "scogen" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.    biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992    to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific    binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are    moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy    outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.    Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to    mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.    biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion    area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.        Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,    you are now able to subscribe to the following:             Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription         ---------                    ------------------------- 	biz.sco.sources			<none> 	biz.sco.binaries		<none>    You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET    NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news    feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and    I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in    source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.    If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive    biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.        The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion    mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a    UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.    Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate    "mailing list subscription" address above, including in the message body:    Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know    major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled    the same way, simply substitute "Delete:" for "Add:", ensuring that    you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list    subscribers receive "how to post to the mlist" article submission    information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive    an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test    message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely    that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do    the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your    connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list    subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have    with the site(s) feeding you.        Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged    drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we    are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a    handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you,    please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site.    What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable):        biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative                         postings relating to past, present, and future                         implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating                         environment and it's various bundled components.        biz.sco.general:     Questions, answers and comments on SCO products                         in general, and of course resulting discussions.        biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of 			interest to current and future users of SCO products, 			and to SCO developers, resellers and distributors.

I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using  my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript  laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been  fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do  some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might  not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to  2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore.  The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a  rather important font :-)  I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the  [Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't  work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files  generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I  manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file  everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs  to work with.  And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are  listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts.  Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works  well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows  applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well.  Has anyone encountered problems like this?  What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1 Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400? I'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats --  X.400:    g=Mats; s=Tande; o=Oslo; p=GR; A=Telemax; C=NO;

Urgent help needed. Daughter has SE 30 and Imagewriter II. Worked well until yesterday. Now when she tries to print from Macwrite II or Acta the printing message comes on, but not printing! Bought new cable, still no printing. Moved cable to modem port, still no printing! I'm a DOS person and don't know where to begin. Are there diagnostics for a MAC?
Why is Win 3.1 sometimes so finicky? I have a new DELL 486DX2/66mhz  8 megs RAM. Windows was working just great.  I had a Bus mouse and mother board problem. DELL replaced the mouse, gave me a newer mouse driver for windows and replaced the motherboard.  Just prior to this problem windows would ]only load up every other time.  I would get the LOGO and either it would go on into windows or LOCK UP.  This was very consistent EVERY OTHER TIME. Now with the new motherboard and all, it still does the same thing. The computer is less than one month old.  At first it worked FINE! I can get into windows each time now with the   win/s command. This forces Standard mode.  Things seem to run slower.  I mainly use windows apps, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem..... plus it is slower. I re-loaded windows, it still does the same thing.  Should I first delete everything in all windows dir's?  I did not because I have so much  added in sub dir's etc. Really puzzling why ENHANCED MODE would not load each time but consistently every other time.  Standard mode each time......

We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking, set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough advertising. I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10). The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you  do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped. As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version. As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else  than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today.

Hi! I recently got hold of an old/obsolete PC. First thing I am trying to do with it, is making it work. Seems the switches in the back have been toggled since last it was used, and I do not have the manual. Can anybody help me to identify this beast, and mail me the prober switch-settings? All I know is that is is a Bondwell 38, made in 1986, most likely a 286, can be toggled between 4.77 and 8 mHz, and looks like no changes have been made. Any information would be appreciated. --  Terje Johansen at Trondheim College of Engineering, Norway. My conscience once became so bad    that it died.
I just put a 33MHz 040 CPU into my Centris 610.  Now I have a math coprocessor, but is it possible to speed up the Centris to run at either 25MHz or 33MHz?? I didn't see any oscillators on the motherboard like the ones on the IIsi's motherboard!  Where is the oscillator for the Centris? Any ideas? Thanks --  ************************************************************************* *************************************************************************

Hi there (I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so I'm posting here.) I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720). It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets.  However, this digitiser makes use of the serial port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver. The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number). I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I? What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a specific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation? Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.) Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I don't think it's the awkward  recursive deletion that's bugging people, it certainly isn't the nice Windows  interfaces for new DOS accessories (CPAV, defrager, undelete). 	As far as I've noticed, it's DoubleSpace crashes. Frankly, the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes I've heard of surprises  me!  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace, it is  less likely to crash (unlike Stacker, which fools the OS... but DO is gullible  anyway :).  DOS 6 _is_ aware of DoubleSpace isn't it? Anyway, good job on DOS 5, and DOS 6 is good for new users.  Just beware the  doublespace!

I have been posting monthly "how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC" posts for a  few months.  Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of  posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize. This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota PHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with  PHONE.  For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at Best wishes, Ashok -- begin SLIP.TXT -- Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring your Modem: a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)    I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use    to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program    and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit    or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.    These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.    NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a          SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR. b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done    automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of    Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the    SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and    phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with    other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver    that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a    batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.    There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and    batch file examples. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring the SLIP drivers: There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available CSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver SLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver SLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver) ETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP) UMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250) Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or ETHERSL.COM for the following reasons: a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART b) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others    have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a    long FTP transfer. c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode d) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with    every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with. Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE) a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:    For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1    slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600 b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the    double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual    packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS    applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all    use this virtual driver at 0x60.    winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in    QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.    pktint.com Instructions for SLIP8250.COM: a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern    University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware    handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP. b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a    V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.    slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600 c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x    DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM    winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM    pktint.com Instructions for ETHERSL.COM: If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You will have to DELETE the line "device=*vcd" from the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm applications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped characters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not recommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:    ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring Windows 3.1: a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]    section.    i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.        COM1Base=03F8        COM1Irq=4        COM2Base=02F8        COM2Irq=3        COM3Base=03E8        COM3Irq=5        This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,        but double-clicking on the "Ports" icon.    ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer        COM1Buffer=10000    iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish        to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that        Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to        another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch        from one session to another, and this value is at the default value        of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.        COM1AutoAssign=0        This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.        Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under "Device Contention", set        the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to        "Never Warn" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Additional notes: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each SLIP session? I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user a permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI each time that I establish a SLIP connection. If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in, please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the configuration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP will not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a situation such as this, you must do the following: Edit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this: [net] name= ip= netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you) arptime=20 packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate) Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file "attrib +r qvtnet.ini" Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address that you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the general configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and IP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK], and you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not be saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected. A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation. Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a file called "myip".  Another file "noip" is essentially a complete QVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step "myip" and "noip" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of Victor's batch file is provided below: ===================================================== slipper com2 pktint.com bootpq -i "ip=\"%%s\""  >> myip bootpq -i "My IP# is: %s" copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini del /q myip echo . echo Ready to run WinQVTnet ===================================================== For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP? PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes immediately if used with ETHERSL.COM PKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below: The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly). [from AUTOEXEC.BAT] lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver) lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers) lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net) lh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com) pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet) Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within Windows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is directed to the file "popmail.bat".  This is what popmail.bat reads like: pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60 cd \popmail popmail cd \ pktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60 exit                    causes the DOS window to close I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications like PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example within two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for Gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each instance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER? I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with a reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these conditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows: a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session b) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session c) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS I get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring compressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with SLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session is active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session is active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same files. While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER, for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode In ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the applications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3 When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX, I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads "IP:incorrect packet type" or "IP:bad version number".  This does not seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on loss of performance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode? In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author -- know.  Chances are that he can fix it. In the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is kosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2 (C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section) I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate ETHERSL.COM This also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box at a time. So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library of Medicine). ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP cd \gm6 search cd \ termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP exit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows If you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing the ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no problem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PHONE Script Files: The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than the University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend. and login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP session with the following command "slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu", followed by my password -- again. Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file - # # CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93 # Last revised 3/28/93 Procedure    Host.CWRU.Login TimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding' Message         "CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1" Message         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond' Quiet ON Expect 'Verification' Message         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2' Message         'Sending your user name and password' Quiet OFF Expect   'Username:' Send '%u<' Expect   'Password:' Private Send '%p<' Reject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted' TimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request' Expect 'CWRU-TS2>' Send 'SLIP<' TimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command' Expect 'IP hostname or address:' Send '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<' TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname' Reject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname' Expect 'Password:' Send '%p<' Reject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'

The quick answer -- there is no "clean" way.  Below is a batch file hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate, port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM, CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory or in your path ... All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection using PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the connection, and unload the driver when you are done ... -- being CWRUSLIP.BAT -- rem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn.

Thanks > >Chris > >  I thought I'd reply to this, though I ain't brad.  AT any case, a lot of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to .bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop (shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think, where VVV is the ver. number.  If that's not true, let me know and I"ll post a corection). This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you have to rename it. NOW, another thing.... this is from the windows' FAQ: your file has to be less than 64 K ( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know). Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size is.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file, such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure about this, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the filename).  ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less. These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawings work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little memory. Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your new win.com in the windows directory.  Also, don't start windows from a directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start. Share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF).

I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a re-work of the logic board.  I opened mine up and found the same re-work, with a small chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two  other chips.  I'd like to know more about it.  Could anyone with any or all of the following information please post it?  Thanks a bunch. 1.	What does the re-work accomplish (i.e., what does it fix)? 2.	What are the technical details of the re-work?  (I'm looking for 	things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected, 	and the pin-outs for those chips.) 3.	Is a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without? 4.	Could the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases of 	the operating system? 	and, finally, 5.	Should I even be concerned about any of this? Keith Folsom

The 950 can output 16 > bit video to a 16" monitor with 1 meg of VRAM and 24 bit with 2 meg. Actually, the Quadra 900 and 950 both have the same SCSI controller,            (running at different speed).  They are not SCSI 2, but can support certain SCSI commands that take advantage of faster drives.  The I/O processors are present on both machines.  The Q950 runs its I/O bus at 25MHz, while the 900's I/O bus is 16MHz. The Quadra 950 supports 16bit color on all monitor sizes, as well as 24bit up to 832 x 624 resolution.  It also supports 1024 x768 resolution.  The 900 supports supports 8bit at 1152 x 870, and does not support 1024 x 768 at all. VRAM on the 950 is 80ns or faster, and 100ns or faster on the 900. -John Rutirasiri

I didn't realize that you were talking about an Apple division other than AppleUS. AppleUS, being the main division, is the one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and configurations for the majority of Apple customers, and it is generally assumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple. At least that's how it has always been in this newsgroup. All other Apple divisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations if they feel like it. I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all the time. It's not a mistake, it's Apple Sweden giving a different name to an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it. -Hades

I have a 5FG and think it is great. I haven't seen the Nanao's so I can't compare, but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is *extremely* good. I've used other Trinitron monitors (e.g. a Sun SS2 color monitors, which is a 19" Trinitron), and think the 5FG is at least as good, perhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across. 	BTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well as missing ACCUCOLOR. It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG can.

I've recently re-uploaded to cica the current (v2.8) version of the working  model of MicroCal Origin, a scientific and technical 2D/3D graphics and data  analysis package for Windows 3.x. The working model is 2D only and puts a promo message on hardcopies, but is largely identical to the full version. Saving Origin files is disabled, but you can save ASCII data sets produced with Origin. It also says it has an expiration date of Sept. 1, 1993. Try it. You may like it, as I do! It's currently at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.17) in the directory /pub/pc/win3/uploads as ORIGIN2.ZIP.

hello, for 2 months I've unsuccessfully attempted to get either a 3rd or 4th serial port working on my system. various systems diagnostics (e.g., MSD, Norton) tell me it's there, but anything I hook up to it can't use it I have two serial ports on the motherboard if I set my internal FAX/modem for com4 the utility programs report a COM3 I've checked to make sure all the IRQs and addresses are correctly (as listed in most manuals) set am I missing something very basic? where should I go from here? any help, even a point in the right direction, would be most appreciated.

RE: Irish/Gaelic TrueType Font wanted - synopsis I wrote: >Can anyone tell me where I can find an MS-Windows TrueType font >that will give me the characters used in writing Irish/Gaelic >in the old style? > >For example, in this font the letter T would look something >like a C with a horizontal bar sitting on the top, and the >letter G would look something like an S with a horizontal >bar sitting on the top.   Many thanks to those who responded to my question.  Unfortunately I have had no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested in geting one, and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting  that description.  This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of  Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the  early part of the century.  This may take me some time to do (in my limited spare time) but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested,  when it is ready. The responses I received are summerised below: for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me.  I contacted Michael and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh, and that he will eventually port them to the PC, but that he will be charging  IR 100 (about $160) for each one. 'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them'.  These are "Durrow" and "American  Uncial-Normal".  I don't know where you can get these but I don't think that they have the effects I am looking for. included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package is very much like what I was describing.  I faxed Casady & Greene for info but got no reply. So that's it.  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available. Colum Twomey.
Hello, a friend a mine has a commodore 386sx and we've put in that machine a second harddisk, he now has 100+200 MB. But the problem is that the 200MB harddisk isn't supported in the bios. Alas there's no user type 47 in the setup. At the moment we use it as a 193MB type but there are I've seen a small program for this once in the BYTE, but I haven't been able to find this. Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this, I used these programs quite a lot in the XT-days, but I don't have these anymore, Seagate used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold.   Help will be greatly appreciated.   Ronald Schalk

Any replies encouraged.  Thanks in ad- > vance. You may have been emailed this, but the IIsi's power supply is not rated to handle the GC board.  Remember when the si came out and everyone complained about it's power supply.  This is one result of apple providing a low-cost computer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end computer (at the time anyways) that couldn't even support their own video board.  Even if this isn't what is causing your problems, you might develop one later. Eric

Thanks for the enlightening post.  Is there a Technical Note on this? The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac, but rather, any of various workstations that use the 68030 cube.    But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice an extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after installing system 7 on it.  Why does the OS suck up so much CPU power?  Also, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference.  I have the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo.  When editing relatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes several seconds, often more than 6 seconds!!  This happens with power cycling turned off.  As usual, MS software is maggot-infested feces.  I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing. -Avery

Several ways are available -- pageview (which I think came with our system, so I can't point), ghostview (with ghostscript), and the new xv 3.00 package all do so.

What are peoples opinions on the above make of hard drives, I seem to have  found a really good bargain on a 170meg drive but I thought I'd check if anyone had any comments to say on this make? Also I'm a bit of a novice with PC's (but an experienced computer user), when connecting and fitting this drive into one of my spare 5 1/4 bays what extras will I need, a cable for starters (I guess :-) , but what about brackets etc... Also I think I might have to change some jumpers on the drive and my original Connar 211meg one. I'll be attaching the second drive to a seperate IDE socket on my controler card. What will I need to change ???? Yet again many thanks to all that have answered me in the past and to any that answer me in the future :-) --     \  /     "Me, the artist, has produced all this with my own imagination    /\/\     and skill...

I have a 105MB IDE drive and am having a few problems! I get  'Data error on drive C' messages when reading some files. The problem is also steadily getting worse. I have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that the drive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly  flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read). Does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these sectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format. I have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE. Technical answers would be appreciated. It would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!! I am running MS-DOS 5 on an AT clone.
Hello All! I recently acquired a CD-ROM drive, a Mitsumi (mfg. Feb/93)   [Hey, it was free :-)   ]    I'm quite pleased with the performance, but it seems to crash a lot when I use PLAYCD.EXE that came with it a DESQview 2.31 - Thoughts?  This mainly happens when my BBS is running in the background and I load the program up.. If I load the program, it doesn't crash, and I start the disk, stop the program and start the BBS its OK, but otherwise I have big problems.. (IE, they can only be solved with a cold boot). If -anybody- can mail me to help me, I would be eternally grateful  (unfortunately, my feed to this group is a little unreliable so I would appreciate  if you could mail, but by all means, post it too because I'm sure somebody else   would like to know...)

   On a few computers which we have here at Sheridan College there are files which we would like to make read only.  I have used the Dos attrib command but some people, who carry around the attrib program in their pockets, have still been able to erase some of the more important files.  Are there any software packages which would make an entire drive read-only? An example, partition the drive into two partitions and have the first drive contain the important files which can be only read and the second drive you could both read and write.     Any and all enquiries or help would be appreciated. thanx.

I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all. My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours. I have also tried a 70 MHz osz, but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died. I am not sure what was the reason for that, but it is to risky to run it to fast. Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems.  But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. So once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!! Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz. Speedometer Report for menes rainer. Prepared April 22, 1993.

Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o wn clockspeed so they wont make truble. The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side. Hope you will have the same success than I had, Rainer

I'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs.  A couple of issues ago, PC Mag listed as Editor's Choices both Conversion Artist and Hijaak for Windows.  Anyone have any experience with those or some others?  I'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, and I'm not making much progress with the screen shots.  :^(   I'm currently using DoDot and I'm about to burn it and the disks it rode it on.  It's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving me crazy.  Tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a TIFF file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left and right sides of the picture [!].  Usually it confines itself to not copying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix for editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.   The one nice thing it has, though, is it's "dither" option.  You'd think that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say, 256 colors to 16 colors.  But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W, you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which turn to white.  For me, this is useful because I can turn light grays on buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the 3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window.   If you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (less buggy!) program can do this as well?

Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drives are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there any substantial interest in developing the flopticals? Just a thought. Kin Chan

[ Lots of stuff deleted because I felt like it ] This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value. I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtle differences between the different vendors. While PC users tend to customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their  command line. So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their perception. Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream of computer users. We here on the net are not mainstream computer users.

Using the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well, but using SM on any of the low-end machines doesn't simply work for a decent action game since it just steals too much time from the CPU. This is a fact. By writing directly to the hardware on an SE, it is possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11kHz) for a cost of approx. 8000 cycles. Exactly how would you do that using the SM, pray tell? The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can carry that extra load using the SM means, and to write directly to the sound hardware on the machines that can't. It's not the politically correct thing, but from the developers' point of view it is. Department of Computer Science, University of Umea, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN

I've got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and I'm looking for a Windows 3.1 Driver for it.  It's based on the Cirrus Logic CL-GD510A-32PC-B chip.  I've contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand and they say that only Windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer. So if there's a V3.1 driver out for this chip set I'd like to know -                        Thanks is advance Ross James

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty. Before it gets empty. > >The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager.

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation. You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel (with the related slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit the sound and remove that command, then when you create your channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks. Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you can too. One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the Sound Manager. -Steve
My friend has a Macintosh IIfx on which he is running System 6.0.7 (not enough memory yet to run Sys7 adequately), and he noticed that when he tries to use Multifinder on this machine, the machine will beep every few seconds incessantly, nonstop. Now, this friend has a tendency to "install" things on his machine rather haphazardly, but he *did* rebuild his System from scratch and it still occurs.  Does this problem sound familiar at all to anyone?  For all I know the problem is caused by something really obscure but if this is a known simple thing (yeah, right...) that someone is familiar with (like "System 6.0.7 Multifinder doesn't run on a Mac IIfx"), or if someone here knows what he should be looking Thanx in advance. --  "Digging in the dirt, stay with me I need support		  Digging in the dirt, find the places I got hurt		Rich Rosen

Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal width hides out on the Tseng Labs ET4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac? I am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000. Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register (3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks) is set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so is there a high bit, and if so, where is it? Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and what would be an appropriate frequency?). The documentation isn't really very clear (tseng.txt from  vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this. My card is a MegaVga/1024 1Mb card. Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios (ver 8.05 I think.) Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all the non-hicolor modes. Great for running X-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni - if your monitor will take it (only just in my case). Please email the answer, as I can't read news very often. Thanks very much, 		David

REPOST: I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

HI,  that might look like a dull request, but I have been following this newgroup for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind.   I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!). The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only problem is that it is quite slow. I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest. I would like to get information about :      - the refresh rates the various cards provide;      - quality of windows drivers;      - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff). Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip  info, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it,  let me know. 	If this information is of any use, here is my system configuration: 	- Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard) 	- monitor DARIUS 14" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768)                                 (can reach 70kHz horizontally)   I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent  enough to record settings. Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me, 					Guy Lamouche

     I know that I've seen this question asked before, but I don't remember seeing any answers..So here it is again:      Does any one know of an ftp site where the WD90C31 driver might reside? I've checked cica, and I'm sure it's not there (I'm refering to the new version of the driver that came out in 2(?)/93).  I have seen it on c-serve, but I hesitate to d/l 1 meg. at 2400 bps unless I really have to!      Alternativly, is it possible to get Paradise (or WD) to mail me the new drivers, or don't they do that.      Finally, is it even worth the hassle of getting these things, or is there not much improvement over my 10/92 version?

Double speed performance from a CD drive does not require SCSI-2 interfacing. The resultant 300 kbps speed is well within the transfer rate of an LC. In other words, I believe you have been given incorrect information.
I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What is really powerful is that it can run the X server without running a window manager. One can then run a special client X program called a window manager, either (1) run  motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook from some home place (like a sparc, or vms). This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager (without killing windows) and then start up another manager. (Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other). Well the question is:   On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to   break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I   want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run   the window manager. --- Please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the large volumes in window.X) Thanks. --  Scott Moody   (206) 773-4313   "There are no answers .. just cross references"      uunet!bcstec!shuksan!scott
Has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so, what have you done to cure it? One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. From then on other workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf  again.  The workstation is set up to share its discs etc. The machine is a 486DX/33, 8MB RAM, with Diamond Stealth video.  It behaves this way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters, including a SMC Elite. It also behaves the same way if I use the Windows VGA driver, rather than the Diamond drivers.

I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PC-based X server. However, after an interval of no activity, my X session ends. This does not happen when I use xscreensaver.  My screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this: xautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 & My hypothesis is that xdm (I use xdmcp to start my X session) detects a period of inactivity from the server, then terminates the session. However, for some reason, this does not happen with xscreensaver. Is there a workaround? I'd prefer responses via e-mail.

: I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one : I already had.  My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable : for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors : on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is,  : the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable : with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But : for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug : in the cable to align these.   Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your IDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle is center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide positioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows: look into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin is pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins 39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide which side is pin 1. : Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. : I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into : the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the "master" drive : and which into the "Slave"?  any help appreciated.  thanks... It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the  docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation, then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't have convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be able to help you). Good Luck Gordon Lang

The idea is  that OS/2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows DOS  sessions.  I  let  XPL (a  shareware calculus program) see around 720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS (where it would see around 610KB of conventional RAM.).  I  also found it really handy for my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course, the  point is  now moot,  since  the OS/2 programs I now write  simply _never_ run into memory limitations.  I never programmed  for Windows, so I don't have much of a comparison here, though....

This is one of the trickiest problems w/ Win 3.1 ... Personally I run Telix 3.2 for DOS under Windows just fine (and 've been waiting for the Win version froever... :) ), but I have to admit I am the exception to the rule: I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines, most of them w/ big problems... Some of the stuff you have to lookout for:  1) ALWAYS run the prog thru a .PIF, never by calling its .exe, 2) In the .PIF _always_ toggle on _lock_application_memory_ --actually this is something MS points out in the readme.wri file, and is especially critical for downloading 3) Go under Ctrl Panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your COM ports 'Alway Warn' --it will help u w. debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4) Check where are u running the mouse from - com port - 5) check the com port addresses from your BIOS setup and from Ctrl Panel/Ports/(Setup?)/Advanced.. These might help u... If yu still have problems, get $100 and buy Procomm+Win.., :) Hope it helps somehow... --  Costas Malamas ____________________________________________________________ Georgia Institute of Technology  OIT UA -- OIT doesn't pay me enough to share their opinions... 
When I use File Manager's disk copy, I find that Windows (3.1) can read the whole 1.2MB disk at one time,  but only 98% of a 1.44 disk. It looks like a problem of memory. However, The PC has 4MB RAM. There should be some  way to allocat more extended memory for disk copy.  Please advise me on this matter. Thanks in advance. Huayong
It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible 486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service: And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80. The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor. The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled, is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster, and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2 compatibility, but I didn't test it. The 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX PGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when  access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available from Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20 only.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs. If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first... I also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K external cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX. IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or can't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it, but if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure about the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't beat it in any significant way. The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail, asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine: Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper. 1-800-677-9781 The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00 But.... I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer. If you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use, So I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions regarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can. jamesc 909-396-0408 --  ========================================= If someone asks if you are a God, you say...

Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously I had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds. Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far. I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds. Parts 	Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of 	speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the 	oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend 	getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one. 	   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for 	   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are: 		   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121) 		   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136) 		   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137) 	   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit. 	   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a 	   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's) 	    	   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins 	   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket. 	   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had 	   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which 	   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up  	   something similar or risk frying your CPU. 	    Procedure 1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here. 2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static     precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do     this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from 	the back of the mac.   3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.     The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release.   4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon     SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.     The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it.                                              5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount 6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A     phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop     it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here. 7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding 	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then 	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case. 8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic     device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle, 	rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release. 	 9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to     free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case. 	 10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of     the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic 	Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The 	motherboard then comes directly out. 	 11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the     CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators 	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation. 	 	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of 	the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure 	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board. 	 	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is 	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is 	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without 	proper care. 	 12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was. 13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the 	old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the 	socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new 	50 mhz clock. 	 14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification. 	 14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place. 15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother     board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard. 	 16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into 	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.     Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place. 	 17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY     DRIVE CABLE. 18) Replace the phillips head screw 19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in. 20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount. 21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn      on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't, 	something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your 	handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences. 	 	Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and 	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and 	be astounded.  	 	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding 	a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up 	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since 	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single 	problem. 	 Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than $50 in parts.

              at Oracle Corporation.  The opinions expressed are those               of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle. I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an   Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to   find out drive performance and these are the values I got Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track. First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values   are. What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the   IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not   be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on   which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap   file speed test program out there? Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I   got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all   why I should load this driver? Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses. -Eric

Is this true?  I've seen it done by running seperate phone cords, but never with real lines.

Hi all, I've read the FAQ, I've fiddled around, but I am still having problems getting my poor old HP9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  I have  the following in my .Xdefaults: XTerm*Font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1 So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  I have NOT set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined, or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist).  I can get some of the characters above 127 to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example, Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  This leads me to believe that the fault lies with the stty settings, which are as follows: speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef> -parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts  -ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc  ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak  isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh  opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop  Anyway, I've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Hi, I'm working on a project that involves storing an application's rendering to an X display and then playing it back again.  Rather than  "reinvent the wheel", it like to find: 	* a file format for saving X protocol. 	* software that saves and replays such a session. Any ideas out there?

Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes, most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar file).  Right now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/... so I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and  now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them. I still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way. Has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun (SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even  tried hard copying all the relevant files into the "right" places and every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it. ///Peter

Serial cables: There are only three output signals: TD, DTR, and RTS. There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI. There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG. I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS. Gordon Lang

I hooked up an old 40meg external mac hardrive to a Powerbook 230.  I  reformatted the drive, copied all the files from the powerbook except the systemfolder, deleted the files from the powerbook (my biggest error, sigh) and then rebooted the whole set up and... chimes of death. I get the following sad mac error,  00000F 000003 I ran Norton and it claims its a bad SCSI driver and suggests replaceing it. I used Apples Disk Tools but I couldn't update the hardrives SCSI driver as it claimed it was in use, but I couldn't even mount the thing (though I could see it when checking the SCSI bus, after turning it on after booting my machine first). What does that error above refer to?  Am I on the right track?  Is there anything I can do short of intialising the drive, since I need the data on there! thanks ed bourne

Greetings, 	I am looking to upgrade my hard drive to a much bigger one since I find myself kinda cramped on space, althuogh I have never filled it I would like the extra comfort of 30 megs or so.  If anyone would like to sell/trade a newish 80 meg or bigger hard drive for 125 straight and 75 with a trade please e-mail me back at johng2matt.ksu.ksu.edu with an offer.  I would also sell my hard drive for about 60$ if you really want it.  it's a 42MB western digital IDE.  Other than that I am not sure what the transfer rate is, but it is pretty fast. faster than my roommates teac drive.  I have addstor running on it now and have had it for about 5 months.  I have *never* had a problem with it and would guarantee it works upon deliveree.  Thanks 			John p.s. I would love a maxtor 130 hard drive
| I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:   |      -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos) |      -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos) |      -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under  | 	Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel |      -	Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS,  | 	talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of | 	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks. | I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup, | and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be: | 	486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram | 	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus | 	15" monitor, 1280x1024 NI | 	3Com Etherlink III 16bit | 	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive | However, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these | together, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise | surprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even | have a 50MHz local bus running... | I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a | 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus | the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind | that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?   Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB. It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may share experience on that.) Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory. So my advice is the 66/VLB. | We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!! | ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or | been uncovered!   | There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish | running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take | a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram). | There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive | don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with | medium size images. Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have paging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys). | I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This | machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec  | on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases | transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large  | images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it | make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice  | (above), for that reason. The bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from 0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the same results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed (5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is lousy. | Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???! The rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come out. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB. | Any information is greatly appreciated. Just some view, not much figures. --

What would be a good platform for some fairly basic video work of the following nature: Reading real video in for playbak in various app's 5-10 Minnutes in length Basic editing features for said video - rearange sequences, adding grapic slides from something like power point etc...  I'm not to familiar with this stuff but would like a good system with crisp performance.  It's for educational/promotional things so the video quality should be decent. I'm thinking Tempest or cyclone, Big drive,loads o ram, Floptical or 128Mb optical ?? - however, I'm not to sure of the various cards and software thats out there. Please email any responses, Thanks Ted Schreiber Mechanical Enginering  Northwestern University

Plus also generating quicktime movies,  etc. MacWeek was generally complimentary about it in the April 12th issue.

Any time I give the modem a reset command [ATZ] while, in windows. The computer locks up. If I give the ATZ command in DOS, it will work. My solution  was to not give the modem the [ATZ] command thru windows. In the PROCOMM + install process I told the program I have a hayes compatible 2400 modem. ATZ was not included in the initialization string & it works fine. I called MS about this, & they didn't have a clue as to what the memory/interupt conflict  could be. The lockup accures using ANY windows comm program that gives the ATZ command.

All, During my attempts to find out how the AT harddisk controller works I stumbled across I/O port 376h. The "normal" controller ports are in the 1F0h-1F7h range, so what does this port do??? The only information I have upto now about this port is that it is a write only port and the information you have to write in it is related to the number of heads on the disks. Could somebody shed some light on this and give me the missing info. Thanks, Engelbert Torremans AT&T-NS-Nl Huizen the Netherlands

(Assuming >a drive which needs formatting) Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT, that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it "knows" about. Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like. IDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug it in and go to FDISK. --

A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi- session compatible CD-ROM drives for what seems like an attractive price: $1500. I've used many other models up to a II ci, but this would be the first I could have my own Mac. Is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued model such as this. I'd like to yank the CD-ROM drive out, put it in a housing and share it with my PC. Is this feasible? The only info I have on the II vi is that it is relatively slow (16MHz), has an 68030 chip with a math coprocessor. I want to add a non-Apple portrait monitor and use this machine for HyperCard stack design. Is this a good buy, or would I be wasting my money? I would appreciate some advice. Thanks!

  How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors   and then erase it without having to redraw everything else?   What's happening is this,       If I draw it using GXcopy, it is drawn in the specified color.  If I erase       it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed, it erases        whatever it overlayed.  I then need to redraw       all of the items it crossed.  Yuch.       If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing        resembling what I requested.  It properly restores the color of        underlying objects in erase mode.   What's the solution?       --  Scott K. Frost                  UUCP: osu-cis!chemabs!scott.frost

I have the Logitech hand scanner for the Mac.  It uses a SCSI interface box that the standard scanner unit plugs into.  I have tried my friend's IBM hand scanner with the scsi box and it works.  See if you can get Logitech to sell you the scsi is contained in the scsi interface box, so it could run up to around $200.  When I upgraded my old style scanner to the new gray scale model, it cost $75; they just gave me a new scan head and software; the box was the same.  The gray scale scanner + interface runs about $300; making it around $200 for the interface. Collin

Hi all, I wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window to show some drawings. This works perfectly for all kind of objects expect large fonts. What happens on the screen is that the right half of the font is not shown. The way I create these things is quite simple; some aggregated code: XFillRectangle(Disp, Pixs, AnyColor, 0, 0, Width, Height); XDraw[Line|Rect|String](...); XCopyArea(Disp, Pixs, Win, 0, 0, Width, Height, 0, 0); I am using a RS6K 340 with BOS 3.2. The question is:   is this a bug in the AIX X-server (may be some PTFs), or did I do   something wrong within my code?? Sorry for the cross-posting, but I really do not know what kind of error it is.

I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday, and installed it into my Gateway DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5 (the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation program recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this "cascade to IRQ8-15" business?   A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that  only DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about 32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus extension to do 32-bit DMA? Yet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode?? Civilization however works fine ( at least so far). Any body knows what I might have done wrong?  Thanks (I am obviously a newbie) -- John
I have a 486/33 IBM clone with two serial ports (com1, com2) and mouse port. Both the serial ports are directly sitting on the mother board.  I tried to install a 2400 buad Hayes internal modem, but it doesnt work.  Once I dial any number the system locks.  I do not hear any click or ring before it the system hangs.  The modem has a 2 pin dip switch to select the appropriate port.  Once  I change the settings on the dip switch, the system starts working again. Then I bought a 2400 baud Hayes external modem and checked the system.  It works fine with both the serial ports.  The internal modem has been checked on another machine and it works fine, but does not work on my machine. Can anyone please help me to find the problem. thanks Narm Gadiraju

I originally posted a complaint about how noisy my PC was. I got several  useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your PC in silence by  removing the fan altogether! Two variables:  1) I always run my PC without the cover, and  2) I'd be willing to attach a CPU cooler if that would make a difference. Should I try to run my PC without a fan? I know it sounds like utter folly so  I'm asking - has anyone done this succesfully? Or tragically? You're answer  may save my PC... Thanks. --  Alexander Lerman (510) 848-4888 (voice)

You're right. You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II 800K 3.5" disk or Apple II 5.25" disk without extra hardware. However, Mac 1.44MB disks can be read and written in a PC 3.5" HD drive with software only.  This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file. It sure gets asked enough.

              at Oracle Corporation.  The opinions expressed are those               of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle. I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 I determined that my 19" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution. However, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely. After some research, I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize.  I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my path, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but not for the family I am using (Helvetica). I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font). The command   xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path). Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a resolution, X appears to pick a stupid default. Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can do to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both). This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "Yup, thats an inch".  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?

I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's, I had mention in a previous article that I was searching for the 300 external drive.  I did call Apple Catalog as recommended and they told me the drives were back ordered until May 8.  I placed an order anyways and two days later I had a visit from Federal Express.  Well, you can guess how I spent my weekend. Of course I ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of PC Exchange when you order from the Apple Catalog.  You may want to check if they have any internal drives. BTW, an older version of GateKeeper (I don't recall which version), hung up my Mac when trying to access a photoCD or audio disk.  I got the newer version which did mention a conflict with the Apple 4.xx CD driver.

Article #61083 (61123 is last): The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple  and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an "idle" temp - not doing lots of bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This is in a Micron computer, without heatsink. I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off.  It makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to the pins on the cpu etc... --  Rob Scholten End of File, Press RETURN to quit Rob, Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks of use, mine did... As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink instead. Work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out) how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if you use Radio Shack junk under $5....Think about that one for a while! Sam --  Gosh..I think I just installed a virus..It was called MS DOS6...

Stupid question from a new IBM PC user: I'm going to be selling my Mac and getting a Gateway 2000. What is the difference between IDE HD and SCSI HD? The GW 486DX-33V comes with a 250MB Western Digital IDE drive. I asked how much more for the Seagate 500MB SCSI drive. The guy asked me "Why are you going with SCSI?".  I was lost for an answer. I just said "I know Seagate better as a company, from a satisfaction point of view". Are SCSI drives faster than IDE?  I'm not buying my GW for another 4 months or so, but this is a question that has bugged me for a while.       - Tom N.

After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing:   1) My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation       problem.   2) That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find      to meet your requirements.        This means that if you server return a response like the following      -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1      You can ask for the follwogin:         -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1        and it will generate it for you.

Of course, if you don't want to be helped, that's   your problem.  ;-) ] > Is this true??? I was under the impression that people on the net had both   > SCSI and IDE working together.      No, it's not true.  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together, but there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542): * You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the   SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives. * You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),   and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI   drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to   the SCSI BIOS, but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)      Back in February, someone asked about IDE and SCSI (this question gets asked again and again).  At the end of this message, I've included an edited copy of my reply.  You might find it interesting.      -- Darryl Okahata DISCLAIMER: this message is the author's personal opinion and does not constitute the support, opinion or policy of Hewlett-Packard or of the little green men that have been following him all day. =============================================================================== > 1)  Is it worth it to get SCSI over IDE?   Will there be a noticable >     decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate?      For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher throughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk ($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a good SCSI controller.      Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix). Unfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage. However, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.      If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's cheaper, and you'll have less headaches. > 4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my >     hard-drive (bernoulli box, CD-rom, Tape Drive, etc).   the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]      No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device, which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the "better"/"high performance" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased (for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are: * Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI   controllers. * CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).   This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card   that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.      Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it works only with Adaptec controllers. > 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a >     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar >     equipment.      Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a high-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound right, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers, you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape backups).  If you want a copy of my "Adaptec 1542 hints and tips" file, send email.      These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card; the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.      SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC compatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows 3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the possible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, "probably", because, while I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really will be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't know for sure.  ]

Hi- Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture   Apple uses in the powerbook Duos?  Or in the powerbook in general? What are the factors that make the Duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop   machine running the same processor at the same speed (25MHz 68030)?  How many   wait states are in the memory system, etc?  What kind of a data bus does it   use?  32-bit or 16-bit?   It's still slow when plugged into a DuoDock. Anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when   making notebooks?  I heard of a 486DX2/66 notebook getting a "whopping" 10   MIPS rating.  A similar desktop machine should be getting about 3 times that,   I guess. -Avery

I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK, but is unhookable to anything standard (CGA,EGA,VGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy diagonal noise.  I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board (double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to be of relatively high quality, so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card.
We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems with some of our applications that use Motif 1.1.  It appears that pointer to the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e., the "w" of (w, client, call) ) is nil.  The client and call pointers are okay in some instances, but bogus in other instances. We are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4.  After compiling X11R5 and all 23 patches (with the MotifBC flag set), we recompiled Motif and then we  recompiled the application. Did we skip a step or leave something out?  Is there a flag that we should have used?  Should we have left Motif alone? Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

We are doing a research about a passive dynamic vision guided vehicle. Completed the first theoric part, we have to make the effective realization of this vehicle. We need the necessary hardware for image acquisition from a videocamera and for their subsequent elaboration (tipically: edge detection). We ask for informations about available products in the market for this purpose (in real time, 20-25 frames/second). Hence we need frame-grabber cards and/or DSP cards for SUN or PC platform.  We are also very interested in receiving comments and suggestions from users of these cards, especially about programming tools. Furthermore we are looking for the same kind of informations about digital controlled Pan&Tilt devices. Thanks in advance Best regards 				Enrico Fedrigo
	WinFax Pro provides you with OCR. It is the OCR from OmniPage. 	Although it is not as customizable it does the job and is auto 	matic (if you want) and much cheaper than the same package 	(Omni Page Professional = $700) sold separatly. 	Last time I check WinFax Pro was only $100 ??

Anyway, at SIMULOG, we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide- shows because of its "-loop" feature that display does not have (display from the *wonderful* ImageMagick package! :-D), but I think I will implement it myself (even a shell-script should do the job) and forget xv.

Windows NT (tm) is becomming usable. There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though. First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box. What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other resourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.   And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone knows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter),  please let me know. The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff. For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster (which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't  produced drivers yet. Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and give the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, whenever you wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into Windows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN. Windows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows though.  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work well enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never heard of anyone else who did either. It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the box, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity. I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint of heart, it's still a beta.  But it's a very GOOD beta. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Redondo Beach, CA \______________________________________/"Blah blah blah ...

I'm glad we (MS) are starting to remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future  releases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the  mid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over the world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS (and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2. The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people until they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the  wayside. Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either stayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that point in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the short term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS 3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows. Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will offer even more in terms of "real" OS features (I work on NT and have no real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a few years ago). 	...Dave Of course these are my opinions. If you want MS's opinions, as a PR person.

When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M harddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space  would cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config- uartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and  you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.   Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a several-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files  with DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like  os, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are  pricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much it would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a  useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though I must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my  computer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to  because I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff,  softPC or trying any unix os!) -Peter

This information is free.	 You get more than what you pay for. 	      Don't sue me if I'm wrong.     OVERVIEW     The DIB image file format is intended to be a "Device Independent  Bitmap"     file  format.  (What Microsoft means by "Device Independent" is unclear to     me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit     pixels.     These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.     If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-     swap all short and long integer values.     By convention, DIB images end in the extension ".BMP".   This  is  because 			      March 15, 1991 				    - 2 -     they  are  a  super-set of earlier "bitmap image files".  Consequently you     will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as "BMP" files.     Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors"  of  DIB     images: 	 o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the 	     form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for 	     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment. 	 o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor 	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager. 	 o   Old-style Bitmap images. 			      March 15, 1991 				    - 3 -     DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS     The DOS DIB images consist of: 	 1.  A "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file	 as  a 	     DIB  file.	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image 	     file, and the offset to the image data. 	 2.  A "BITMAPINFOHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image 	     attributes. 	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists, 	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows 	     RGBQUAD structure. 	 4.  The image data itself.     The OS/2 DIB images consist of: 	 1.  The same "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file 	     as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the 	     image file, and the offset to the image data. 	 2.  A "BITMAPCOREHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image 	     attributes. 	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this 	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a 	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure. 	 4.  The image data itself.     The Old Style image bitmap consists of: 	 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header 	     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value. 	 2.  An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of 	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a 	     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header 	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER). 	 3.  The image data itself.     CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.     Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps.     The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header     structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  "windows.h"	include	 file.     Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit     images.  The five general steps are: 	 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER 	     structures the basic image information. 	 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the 	     color palette of RGBQUADS. 	 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in 			      March 15, 1991 				    - 4 - 	     the "bfSize" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER. 	 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the 	     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  "bfOffBits"	field  of  the 	     BITMAPFILEHEADER. 	 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER, 	     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).     The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type-     defined  keywords.	The following table describes these keywords for those     not familiar with MicroSoft C. 		     _______________________________________ 		    |					   | 		    | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.| 		    |______________________________________| 		    | typedef |	 meaning		   | 		    |_________|____________________________| 		    | BYTE    |	 unsigned character	   | 		    | WORD    |	 two byte unsigned integer | 		    | DWORD   |	 four byte unsigned integer| 		    |_________|____________________________| 			      March 15, 1991 				    - 5 -     THE BITMAPFILEHEADER     This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: 	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER { 		 WORD	 bfType; 		 DWORD	 bfSize; 		 WORD	 bfReserved1; 		 WORD	 bfReserved2; 		 DWORD	 bfOffBits; 	 } BITMAPFILEHEADER;     The "bfType" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves     to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered     machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the     quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.     The "bfSize" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this     field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the     BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times     the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the     image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be     calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in     later.     Both the "bfReserved1" and the "bfReserved2"  fields  are  always  set  to     zero.     The "bfOffBits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data     from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set     to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the     BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times     the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written     write after the color palette if one exists. 			      March 15, 1991 				    - 6 -     THE BITMAPINFOHEADER     This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: 	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{ 		 DWORD	 biSize; 		 DWORD	 biWidth; 		 DWORD	 biHeight; 		 WORD	 biPlanes; 		 WORD	 biBitCount; 		 DWORD	 biCompression; 		 DWORD	 biSizeImage; 		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter; 		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter; 		 DWORD	 biClrUsed; 		 DWORD	 biClrImportant; 	 } BITMAPINFOHEADER;     The "biSize" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure     itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to     determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a     BITMAPCOREHEADER.     The "biWidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels.     The "biHeight" field is the height of the image in image lines.     The "biPlanes" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out     as if there was one color plane.     The "biBitCount" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either     1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.     The "biCompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is     compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.     However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how     it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the     data is not compressed.     All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to     zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to     compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.     The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biClrUsed".     For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the     possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  "biClrUsed"     colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may     only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set     this field to zero. 			      March 15, 1991 				    - 7 -     COLOR PALETTES     Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD     structure is defined in the "windows.h" include file as: 	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD { 		 BYTE	 rgbBlue; 		 BYTE	 rgbGreen; 		 BYTE	 rgbRed; 		 BYTE	 rgbReserved; 	 } RGBQUAD;     The "rgbReserved" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount     of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is     written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  "rgbBlue",  "rgbGreen",  or     "rgbRed"   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not     contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these     fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color     composition.     IMAGE DATA     There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image     file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and     certainly was.     Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four     byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel     wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The     number of bytes per line can be calculated as: 		 bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4; 	---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure--- 		 bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;     When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.     The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the     first line of image data in the file.     For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would     expect.   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit     images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one     pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.     However, for 24-bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the     order  blue,  green, red.  While most image file formats write data out in 			      March 15, 1991 				    - 8 -     an "RGB" ordering, a DIB image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 "BGR"     ordering.     SUMMARY     This  should  provide  enough  information	to  create  DIB	 images	  from     applications  such	as  scanners  or for image exporting routines.	If you     find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on	to  me     so that I can modify this document accordingly.

For the past week or so I've been trying to install a QIC-36 tape drive and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 EISA system with no luck. I end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read part of the test. I am pretty certain that the port setting, irq & dma are set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind, retension, write and erase, I also booted the system clean and still the same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. It has been suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down. My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do this. Am I going to have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work around? I will be glad to hear your advice/suggestions. Tony
: So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize : quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them : that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has : done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot : easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world : but that will not change their perception. None of this changes the fact that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior to its competition. I have begun to learn in life that the masses never choose the best option available to them-- they choose the one which they have been conditioned to  think is best.  I'm glad I'm not one of them.   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + Kurt D.

I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM. It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers. The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours. Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours. Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using Hint chipsets. Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab. Using ET4000/W32 drivers 640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.         32k        7.34          64k        7.30 800x600 256       10.07         32k        6.38         64k        6.35 1kx786  256        8.17 Using ET4000 drivers. 640x480 16M        1.78 800x600  16colours 4.01      1kx786   16        4.22 From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card. The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer. It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it which supports 256 colors on all resolution. From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card in 256 colours mode. Philip Sinn University of Washington * It is all my opinions *

On 800k Mac disk drives, the spin rate of the disk is varied so  that the tracks pass under the head at a constant speed; a slower rotation for the outer tracks, and a faster rotation for the inner tracks.  A PC needs special controller hardware to make this happen. Brian Casey

My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time. Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of "free interrupts."  I had a tape controller (not a "floppy tape") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an *old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would most likely "hang.")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for the serial port. Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7. Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-) --  Kenneth R. Ballou				VOICE:		 (617) 494-0990 Oberon Software, Inc.

Hi, I'm having problems tying to get a Sony DAT drive to work.  I'm using Retrospect 1.3Ci, and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci, which has now unfortunately gone to another department.   Ideally, we want to attach it to our Quadra 950 setup.  I can't seem to get the Retrospect software to recognize the media at all.  When in the "Devices" dialog, it can see the DAT device, but comes up with, firstly, 'Running', secondly 'Media Failure' and then immediately 'Contents Unknown'.  This does not happen with the Mac IIci setup, which simply says 'Ready'.   I'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some solution... I  know some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra, but they have a Mac IIci which they can use!    THE SYMPTOMS System software is 7.1, also didn't work with 7.0.1   I have tried the following:   Turn off all extensions, except Retrospect SCSI (required)   Tested on a variety of machines:  Quadra, IIsi, and LC (at least).   Connected no other SCSI devices   Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc.   Replaced the DAT unit with a new one (Yes!  we got that desperate!)   Read the Retrospect manual (EVEN MORE DESPERATE :)) Replies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance.  I'll post any solutions to this group.

Make sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being executed from the DOS directory. Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not, I don't know what might cause the startup delay.  My testbed for DBLSPACE (which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in  about 20 seconds from the "Starting MS-DOS" herald to the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT execution.  I don't have handy a system with a more realistic volume of data to time. Joe Morris / MITRE
I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA counterparts. For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E is only about as "fast" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't what I would call "fast." I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the same level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits. Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a Diamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report, I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it's around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend. And, for $500, I could get a Diamond Viper and still have $100 left over (of course, I'd have to get a Local Bus mother- board too...) Can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?
I need to find how to program the WD7000 FAAST SCSI controller (A 16 bit DMA SCSI controller for the PC (ISA bus)). Can somebody point me in the direction of some low level docs on the net? Or will I have to get hold of the manufacturers? Who did actually make this anyway? Who will have the docs? TIA.

On one, he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter, and it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter). In other cases, I've run the doublespace installation without a problem when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.

It's still faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression, I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin load before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those. Personally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those hooks and stuff.

One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements (hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to 20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how many processes are needed for each character.) While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like 10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many as 50.

 I just thought I would pass along my experience with APS. I recently ordered  an external Quantum 240. The salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable, the  order came when promised, and the invoice was at the price quoted.   Installing the drive was simple; I didn't even have to read the manual. The  SCSI address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. I daisy-chained the drive  from my Syquest (also from APS) and booted up with no problems.   I'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. It's a  pretty good assortment.  The drive/fan is a bit noisier than I would like, but I think it'll be OK.  The speed seems very good, although I haven't run any objective tests. It  also seems to spin up pretty quickly; I can hit the power switch for it, and  almost immediately power the Mac without any problems booting from the drive.  Some observations: the case is plastic (good quality, though) while my older  Syquest case is metal. There is one LED, which is normally green, and  flickers red as the drive is accessed.

I've also spoken to a few  people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble (and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed). -Brian

The exception to this is for CPU's used in laptops, where the CPU can enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but doing absolutely nothing.  In this case it needs a hardware interrupt to get it going again. -- _____________________________________________________________________ Communications Research Group University of Manchester ---------------------------------------------------------------------

I used to hate it when people posted messages like this, but now that I am contemplating a purchase, I can see why they do. So, has anyone heard of any upcoming (within the next 6 months) advances in the Powerbook line?  Can we expect to see a PowerPC PowerBook at some point in the future (I assume an 040 would take too much power and generate too much heat for installation in a PowerBook)? Thanks for your help.

Hi: I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs! I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:        -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)      -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)      -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under  	Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel      -	Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS,  	talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of 	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks. I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup, and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be: 	486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram 	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus 	15" monitor, 1280x1024 NI 	3Com Etherlink III 16bit 	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive However, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these together, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise surprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running... I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?   Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any  speedy help would be appreciated even more!!) BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following  configuration: 	486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram 	ATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram 	14" monitor, 1024x768 NI 	SMC Ethercard 8 bit 	Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!! ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or been uncovered!   There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram). There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images. I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec  on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large  images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice  (above), for that reason. Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???! Any information is greatly appreciated. ----- John P. Robarts Research Institute   | P.O.

    I am thinking about buying a new motherboard and a cyrix 486dlc 40 or 33 Mh z.  It will be an upgrade from a 386sx 25.  I was wondering if anybody has any FACTS they can fill me in on.  If anybody has one what do you think about it? I will also get a cyrix math co with it.  I have benchmarks for the two chips a nd they look very good for the price.  If anybody responds please send me email  because I usually don't check the mail very often but I check my reader daily.     Thanks for your info, and remember only respond if you have legitimate comp laints or praise, not just to Cyrix/AMD bash.  I know about what Byte, computer  shopper, pc computing and etc... have said and that is why I am considering the Cyrix chip.  Thanks.........
Here's the scoop: For the past two years, I have been using an SE/30 with a Sony 1304s and a Lapis video card.  This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now  using the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who is planning on getting an Apple 14" monitor (The Trinitron one).  My question is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple monitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up the power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my  Quadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which allows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the socket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow him to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?  IF yes, where can he purchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables? Thanks in advance, Derek ****************************************************************************** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bldg 54-1511A                          * Clark Laboratory 317 Massachusetts Institute of Technology  * Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Cambridge, MA 02139                    * Woods Hole, MA 02543 (617) 253-2922                         * (508) 457-2000 x2814 *******************************************************************************
Sorry, this must be a FAQ, but it's a quick fix that I need to take care of   before a demo in less than 24 hours from now! Couldn't think of a better place   for a rapid answer than comp.sys.mac.hardware. I need to connect the Serial A of a Compac 386/20 PC to the printer port of a   Mac IIci. Does anyone have handy the pin-pin routing for the cable that would   allow this connection?  The serial port on the Compaq is a MALE DB9. How would this map to the DIN8 of   the Mac serial? I tried one of those really short femaleDB9-maleDIN8 cables   that Apple sold as adaptors to plug in Macintosh serial peripherals from the   pre-MacPlus era. This cable didn't do it. Do I need a null modem adaptor as   well on the DB9 side of things?  I just need to be able to map the data TX and RX pins correctly. thanks kindly, Atau Tanaka

Hello 	I recently accelerated my Mac Plus (MicroMac 25MHz accelerator)  and now I can't get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk.  It boots fine  from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I  cannot get it to boot from the hard drive.  I installed a new driver, so I  don't think that is the problem.   	This poses a rather large problem.  I only have 4 Meg of RAM, and  I need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg.  I was hoping to use  system 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica.  However, I can't  run system 7 from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM.   	Any suggestions? Thanks for your time--

Ghostview is a postscript previewer that uses ghostscript. From the ghostview README:     Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript. Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4. Brief list of features:   - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring     Conventions.   - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring     Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.   - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.   - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or     application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our     European friends.   - Scrollbars appear when necessary.   - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring     Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.   - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,     and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).   - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale      or color on a Color monitor.)   - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that     printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)   - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution     (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).     The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people     are encouraged to use in other programs.     Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:         prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z         appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z From the ghostscript README: ***************************************************** * This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. * ***************************************************** ******** ******** An overview of Ghostscript ******** ******** Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:         - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and         - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the Ghostscript language.

Hi folks, I'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0, and I'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically, make bombs when it needs to use any Xaw file.  This isn't surprising since X11 files on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under /usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!) Actually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I don't know how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the  Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the  Makefile reads     # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit! Help!

I have been backing up my hard drive ever since I had to re-install everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't I?!). I am using a windows-based backup program (actually Norton), and I  began wondering about the logic of this.  Sure, if I accidentally delete a file, I can get it from the archive.  But what if my disk crashes again? I would not be able to start windows to run the backup program!  (Note, by crash, I mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine from booting properly.  I think I gave up too early, but I didn't have the time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was.  My hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. Yeah right...)  This whole scenario is complicated by the fact that I am using Stacker. So I think there are 2 possibilities:    1) I'm right.  If my disk really crashes, I would at least have to       re-install DOS and Windows to get the backup program working.    2) I'm wrong.  There is an easy way to make a "mirror" of a hard disk       that can easily restore it's state from scratch. The polls are open... Tom Ioerger Univeristy of Illinois, CS grad student

The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace. This happens intermittently to Macs in our department, ranging from IIsi's to a Quadra 950. I can end the slowdown immediately by unplugging the Ethernet cable from the Mac. It seems that something on the network puts out these packet storms every few days.

I was reading a review of the Centris 610 in this  months MacWorld and the reviewer said that for  $4 you could make an adjustment on the clock speed of the chip and change it from 20mhz to 25mhz.  I  haven't heard of this before, and I don't think that this is the 040 chip replacement (with fpu) that I have seen so much talk about.  Anyone have any ideas?

I guess the real question is: Who asked the original questions, and why was it so _broad_. Are we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing BTW) isolated from every other factor and influence in the system?   Or are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs (yuck)! I just finished a project that involves real-time processing of serial data and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has _a lot_ to do with the "power" of a CPU in a particular application. If what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given, then not only is it easy, but it's cheap and quick.  If you have to fake things (like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction), then your cycle count goes through the roof! well, let's _NOT_ start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose. The orginal question was about classifying micro-processors... having re-read the entire thread, I don't think much more can be said without getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given. That's it for another $0.02.

I posted almost the same bad experience with  Midwest Micro but our %^*^&*^&* news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. In addition to the facts that: (a) the modems (I had ordered two) wouldn't work as documented and (b) the tech person had NO CLUE as to how it should work, it also turned out that: (c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly USED but the techs thought that was standard practice and (d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and my CMS250 tape drive start running away. That they are incompetent is one thing, but that they sell used stuff as new and won't even apologize for it is another. Stay away from these crooks! Bob Wilson
Interesting delema for all those out there. My school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio 100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections.  (no joke)  Here is the deal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a disection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow drawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know NADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing list?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms. Ok here it goes: 	We are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms offered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price and reliability, the second being VERY important. 	How much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you think? 	Ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard (extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time great wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is just a reliable?  Price? Thermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit access so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in terms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?)  Price? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is the Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650.  Suggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through and they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy to maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc). 	Finally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting these things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the net, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask them? 	Little more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot about macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the time to go and look for all of this stuff. So I am hoping the collective resources and intelect of the net can help (Has before) [Shameless plug: BUY EMPOWER!!! Great Security Program!!!] University.  They do not condone in any way my using this media to illict info. This is a proj by bio majors so they re the real persons. 	Anyinfo please send to the email above or to make it real clear s there is not another stupid blank post. 	I reserve the right to claim all this info as mine and use it to get everything I want form my Universities red taped administration.  This info may be used for blackmail purposes and for obtaining undo amounts of praise and god like status. This info may also be used to get credits I probaly really don't deserve.

The point out that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a number of folks problems. MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard). Cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $67.50,  for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold.  I want to see the MS spin doctors explain this.

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1). The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike in the major version number, is:   o undo has been implemented.     By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is     provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,     levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is     supported. There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)                           -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of what it is all about: aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it features, amongst other things,    o multiple windows    o multiple buffers    o default menu interface    o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons       under user control    o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters    o provision for defining a keyboard macro    o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters    o file selection via a browser    o knowledge of line numbers    o parenthesis matching    o regular expression searching    o restricted or unlimited undo    o ability to change font    o easy entry of control codes    o xterm-like keymap feature    o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)    o both brief and comprehensive on-line help    o server mode with cooperating client programs    o optional extension language using Tcl    o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability    o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and Xaw3d options, on the following systems:    Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5    Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5    Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5    DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5    HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5    MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5     but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first. A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is provided for those systems that do not have one. Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release, 2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2 never got converted to make use of it. aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due course from several other ftp sites.

Hello All!     It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking - secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the applications that need fonts?  Any ideas? Chris

I pulled down the pre-compiled executables made for Sun for Tcpview, but I'm getting a whole slew of the following types of error messages when I try to start it up:   Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfActivate:ManagerParentActivate()'   Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfCancel:ManagerParentCancel()'   Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfSelect:ManagerGadgetSelect()'   ... But I *know* I have those in my keysym:   egrep "osfActivate|osfCancel|osfSelect" $OPENWINHOME/lib/XKeysymDB yields:   osfActivate             :1004FF44   osfSelect               :1004FF60   osfCancel               :1004FF69   osfSelectAll            :1004FF71 and, if I take *out* the osf lines from said XKeysymDB, my copy of wscrawl (another Motif-compiled-for-Sun program) gives the same type of complaints as listed above.

Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color, say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000. My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the "original" part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else is a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created. For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area. What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a  re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window? Second question: Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are??? Thanks, Chris

Interesting.  Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on its side horizontally?

Then again, maybe $2445 for the gateway system isn't too cheap. I have a system from Micron computers: 486-2-50, 16 meg ram, 245 Maxtor HD, Local bus IDE / 2 meg video card, and the same 15" monitor.  The system with shipping came to $2200.  I sold the sx-33 chip that came with it and bought a dx2-50.  Total price $2300-2400.
I have a 386 clone, and an internal modem set to COM4. It worked fine until I upgraded to DOS 6.0 and at the same time reloaded Windows 3.1  Now the system can't find COM4; MSD says COM4 is "N/A", and three of my four comm programs say "hardware not present" or some similar error message.  Procomm, however, finds the modem no problem and works fine!  Curiouser and curiouser.  Any hints/help?  Thanks.

I'm currently trying to select which magneto-optical drive to purchase.  I'm primarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones. When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drives seem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MB Portable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for the FWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128).  Different drives use different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others. My problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser reviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get.  So, I'm asking if anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shed some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me much?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or  anything else I should probably know. Thanks. 	John Sasinowski

I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5" drives, in particular, the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive.

Hi everyone,       I'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing on the HP Deskwriter (Sys 7.1, Deskwriter driver 3.1, PowerBook 170). When I print from, say, MS Word, I see the message "Spooling to disk," but sometimes nothing prints. Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus, I see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded. Restarting fixes this. It seems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that its status as "Multifinder NOT aware" allows it to do this without my being informed by a message such as "HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly." Have you ever seen this problem before.         There may or may not be a related problem. I have experienced problems in putting my computer to sleep. Choosing "sleep" from the Finder menu sometimes does nothing. Today on a whim I checked the memory map, and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded. Restarted reloaded HP backgrounder, and I was able to put my machine to sleep as usual. Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventing my machine from going to sleep? 	Has anyone seen this problem? I'm seriously considering the purchase of a StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software.  	Please send your answers directly to me and post to the net. 	Yours truly, 	Marc Bizer
A friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a HD disk. Apparently it rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or _something_ that allows it get more space out of a normal HD floppy disk.  It supposedly gets upto 1.6 Megs (so something like 1640K?). I don't have the program - since I can't use it and its supposed to be called something like "FORM16" or something like that. My question is whether its possible to do this on the Mac and if its not possible is it due to hardware limitations. A developer friend of mine said that it might be possible but he doesn't deal with this aspect of the field much. Thanks for any information contributed. Steve

Hi,     Can somebody tell me step by step how to add a 40Mb IDE Kalok? HD to an existing 120Mb IDE Maxtor HD with Stacker 3.0 and DOS 5? I know how to set the jumpers on the 40M to be slave and the settings for heads, wpcom, sectors, etc. I also know that I have to do some CMOS settings and fdisk. The problem is: what letter will the CMOS give the new drive? If it's D:, what will happen when Stacker creates D: and swap? Can I tell CMOS to make it E:? So that if I Stack it, I will have C, D, E and F?     I know this could be an FAQ or in a readme somewhere, but I want to hear from somebody who've actually done it. Thanks! 							     Romy
: Hi! : 	 : Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software : programming to change the IP numbers on an ethernet card? : 	 : Thanks in Advance! :  : --  : =-Dave   *Tigger!* :  : Dave C Johnson I think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence. This is a "physical layer" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol. The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or I) physical identification scheme (number). But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number) it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that. If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly changable.  But it is strictly software. Gordon Lang
<clip clip> >Interesting.  Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster >Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?  I assure >you that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My >computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone. Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified explanation. Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer adapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that "Something's happening here, please take note." How the CPU is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system. In MS-DOS, the "interrupt vector" is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt. Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When DOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there, wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB.  With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU cycles.) Hence, you can't "share" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot. Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is needed. You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came from. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well. Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the general picture correctly enough.

For example, if I get a program executing: -------------- #!/bin/sh read something .... .... echo $something .... .... -------------- and if I send the key event "<KeyPress>a,<KeyRelease>a" to that window then I will get: something=a Thanks in advance. --     Gabriel Iban~ez C.

hi,   just a quick question reguarding pc tape backup. I own a 386 dos box and have an Archive VP402 interface card connected to a QIC-02 tape drive. Now the simple question is, does anybody in netland know were I can get some software for msdos (ver 5.0) to run this setup, freeware or shareware preferred .

>If anyone has any information about the upcoming new computers >(Cyclone and Tempest), I am in need of some info. Anything would be >greatly appreciated. >-Shawn According to MacWeek of 2-22-93: The Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra 800, while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris 610. Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take pictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit digital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards, the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels, with 256 gray levels, on the screen. Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera is expected to cost between $150 and $250. The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's Casper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone. The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer. The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support for up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an FPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards. Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the Cyclone's. For more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek.
In Win 3.1, one may assign hot-keys for the program items within the Program Manager. How about the Program Manager itself? Is there one already, or is there some way to assign one?

A lot of the time, when you're dealing with someone who has no financial   interest in selling you the machine, you get a lot of opinion (as opposed   to factual information, etc.).  What it sounds like to me is that this guy   has had an experience with one flaky Centris 610 and formed an   all-encompassing opinion on the rest of the 610's.  I've seen lots of   people who frustrated me to no end because they refused to believe any   other Mac Xyz would be any good, since their experience (with >one<   machine) with a Mac Xyz had been bad.  Their loss, eh?      Andrew W. Duthie

SCO ODT allows to adapt the X-Server to any non-standard (AT) keyboard  using the Xkeyboard configuration compiler xsconfig. SCO provides some configuration files in /usr/lib/X11/xsconfig/*.kbd, e.g. for  Siemens WX200. Question: Is there anywhere a configuration file for the HP46021A keyboard available ?  I am especially interested in using the HP specific keys such as  "InsertLine", "Menu". Thanks  -Ron.

[discussing the use of IRQ 7] >I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written >(I can't prove it's true, but I believe it), LPT1 does not >actually use IRQ7, even though that interrupt is supposed to >be dedicated to LPT1. To put it a little differently:  - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the    printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.  - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's    time to send out another byte to the printer.  - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable    the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between    the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the    IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it    in the high-impedence mode.  - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate    drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines    rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't    assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes    the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically     disconnected by a jumper.    (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold    the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true    you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and    that certainly isn't a requirement.)  - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the    proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance    reasons.   And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.

The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at 76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly. When buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation LX, you might consider a monitor that's fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76Hz. I don't know for sure whether the LX supports this (Sun certainly won't tell you) so you'll have to check. Philips Consumer Electronics, Eindhoven, the Netherlands

  Hi.  One of my coworkers is having a very odd problem.  His mouse works fine in DOS applications, if you load them from the C: prompt. Under Windows, the mouse pointer is present, but does not move.  Even if you load a DOS app under Windows, the mouse doesn't work.   The computer is a Zeos 386SX-20 w/Diamond Speedstar VGA running MS DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1.  Mouse driver is Microsoft's 8.2.  I've tried switching the mouse from COM1 to COM2, I've tried a different mouse, I've reinstalled MOUSE.DRV, and I can't get the blamed thing to work. The only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse works perfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additional parallel and serial port.  Could that cause the problem?    Thanks in advance for any help. --  "If you can't laugh at yourself, then you can bet that everyone else is doing so." - Ed Johnston
I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet.  The nameplate does not  specify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he  has a LJ I.   His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to  print the forms properly. This unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported  dowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not  the plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction  of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font. Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?   Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable  cost? Any suggestions would be welcome.

The supplemental manual that comes with the Quadra 800 explains it. I don't have the manual in front of me, but as I recall, you insert the CD while the machine is running, select Restart from the special menu, and then hold down a special sequence of keys to force it to boot from the CD instead of the hard disk. I think the key combination is Command-Option-Delete or Command-Ctrl-Del.

The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the CD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.   You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster reading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD, but only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD. Paul
C A L L   F O R   V O T E -------------------------   This is the official Call For a Vote on the creation of 3 newsgroups for those engaged or interested in all areas relating to the PUBLISHING OF ANY SORT OF CDROM MATERIAL. Please repost this CFV to any newsgroup, listserver or reflector that you think might have a group interested in this subject in order to reach as broad an audience as possible. Every vote counts, so make sure you register yours if you want these groups to be created.   Proposed Groups --------------- comp.publish.cdrom.hardware comp.publish.cdrom.software comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia   Status ------ Unmoderated.   Voting Period ------------- How To Vote ----------- -To vote, simply copy the example below and delete either the "Yes" or the "No" before each group to register your vote for or against the creation of that group. A line containing "Yes/No" as in the example below, will be considered an abstention with respect to that particular group. Note that each group will have its own separate vote count and that you may split your vote for the groups or abstain as you will. Please provide your Name and E-mail address as shown in the example below. 		Email your  vote following this 		example..... ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 I  vote "Yes/No" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.software" I  vote "Yes/No" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.hardware" I  vote "Yes/No" for the creation of "comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia" 	[Last Name], [First Name] [(E-mail Address)] 	. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Voting Rules ------------ -Only one vote per user (Two different people cannot vote under the  same user name). -Any votes which are received before or after the voting period  will be discarded. -Anyone who wants to change their previous vote may do so by voting  again.  They must indicate that they have previously voted and are  changing their mind in a footnote.  A changed vote will discard your  previous vote. -Email messages sent to the above addresses must constitute unambiguous  and unconditional votes for/against newsgroup creation as proposed.  Conditional votes will not be accepted. -Only votes emailed to the above addresses will be counted; mailed  replies to this posting will be discarded. -In the event that more than one vote is placed by an individual, only  the first vote will be counted unless it was changed as above. -No information will be supplied as to how people are voting until the  final acknowledgment is made at the end, at which time the full vote  will be made public. Ambiguous Votes --------------- Ambiguous votes -- those who do not follow the specified format, or  do not make clear the voter's intent, will, where possible,  be  returned to their senders for clarification.  Ambiguous votes which  cannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is  provided will be identified in the final vote tally. Every Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!! Rationale --------- The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted  to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not, and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.   The reason for the division into three groups is a natural partition of interest between the hardware and software topics, and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R,  Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well.  Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.   The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging software, data capture software, data clean up, compression, encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.   The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and video.   The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture, such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as information that publishers need to know about the hardware that the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.   Notes ----- These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like. Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.   Charter -------   Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE   The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for  discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:   	Index and retrieval software   	Authoring software   	Scanning and imaging software   	OCR and OCR cleanup   	Hypertext   	SGML   	Premastering and Simulation (cdrom) software   	Copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms   	Other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing   Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE   The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for  discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:   	CD-R equipment   	Data capture hardware   	Scanners   	Video and audio capture hardware   	Networking hardware   	Midi hardware   	Photo CD hardware   	Publishing systems   	CDI and DVI hardware   	Compression and encryption hardware   	Keyboarding   	Other hardware publishing topics   Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA   The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for  discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them:   	Multimedia authoring software   	Imaging software   	Audio and Midi software   	Color control software   	Video editing software   	Audio editing software   	Multimedia utilities useful for publishers   	Integration of text, image, audio and video   	Compression and encryption of multimedia   	Multimedia copyright and related legal issues   	Multimedia databases and hypertext   	Other multimedia publishing topics --  	Brooklyn, NY            * 				of anyone else :-)  ????!

:  : 	I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem : cable. (Actually I have NO idea, so don't count that last statement.)  What I'm : asking is what pins does it use (or what are it's specifications?)  I just want : to solder one myself instead of buying one.  I don't even know what port is : used. :  :  : Kevin :  : p.s.  I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or : Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.) I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null- modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems, but you should still check your software! I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is a "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9.  The primary signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG). There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE. For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR) signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS) signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest) are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect - a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup. DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the "connection" has been established i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows: Name    DB-9     DB-25  SG       5        7  TD       3        2  RD       2        3 DTR       4       20 DSR       6        6 DCD       1        8 RTS       7        4 CTS       8        5  RI       9       22 Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232 signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG, and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap- Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications, one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape" codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair game.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way, I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more "gotcha" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control, if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use this one.

You turn on your computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it cools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles of this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal cycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it off (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the phosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :")  Charles Kuehmann Northwestern University Steel Research Group

If you could provide some prices too that would help.  I'm not informed enough on Powerbooks to know how well they operate.   	I have been following the posts on some of the problems that have been encountered such as the trackball not working in the horizontal. 	I would appreciate the list as well as any advice you may have. 		Thanks in advance. 				Kordi A. 				Wichita State University	
I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as a front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch of mail as "foo.txt ." I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load "foo.txt" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course pose file name contention problems. What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword that would move "foo.txt" to a specified directory, rename it using the current date and time, and delete the original "foo.txt ." In other words, "foo.txt" gets renamed as "5012300", say, on May 1 at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and "foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec macro points to it. My main question is this:  How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a  time/date variable in the new filename?

   Hi,    I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this    LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.    My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882    on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,    the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but    I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when    it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have    any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance. From what I've heard the PDS slot clock is only 16MHz, to be compatible with the old LC style boards, while the FPU socket close to the CPU is clocked at 25MHz. I guess a board designed for the LCIII can get a 25MHz clock from the extended PDS socket... -- Snail mail:     Communicator Nexus AB     Phone:  +46 18 171814                 Box 857                   Fax:    +46 18 696516                 S - 751 08 Uppsala, Sweden

The X Window System Conference  remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what folks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11. Speakers at Xhibition 93 include:    Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett,    Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick,    Doug Young, and many others. Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational; and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT. With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing applications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many desktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and suppliers. The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has what you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development Kits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself. I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a confusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of the other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion. -Aub Harden  Technical Program Manager         X H I B I T I O N   The Conference and Trade          ******    *****    Show for Corporate         *      *       *    Software Development          ******     ***                *         *    201 Broadway           ***     *****     Cambridge, MA  02139               Windows on Distributed Computing                  June 7 - 11,   San Jose, CA         Voice: (617) 621-0060  Fax: (617) 621-9555       Presented by Integrated Computer Solutions, Inc.
I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a Novell administrator's point of view.   I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they (Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support, the LOCAL setup (described below) as the "most advantageous installation". If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.   The LOCAL Windows Installation: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the resources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation, he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A. Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network to install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.   Advantages: - Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to   the local access of main Windows files. - Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point   or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing   and reduce the cost of down-time. - Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard   drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network   has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster   access than local ones. - A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about   varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the   Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.   Disadvantages: - Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk   space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can   increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent. - Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to administer.   New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of   which would have to be individually installed on each workstation. - Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system   files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for   administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations. - Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup   sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.   Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be   eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable   applications and *not* user data.   The SHARED Windows Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure described above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of files to individual "user" directories.  These directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network "home" directory.  The bulk of the Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory (some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout their Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include group files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.   Advantages: - A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As   an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this   single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it. - Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,   the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct   problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI. - Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files   are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with   all driver updates.   Disadvantages: - Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network   directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the   speed of Windows. - If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's   is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs   as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will   usually not be able to save their work. - Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files   are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a   significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows   files alone. - Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation   hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being   tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).    The Discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows userbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money.   I would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how Windows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is "putting all eggs in one basket"; if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.   Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to hear from people with "actual" working experience with users and network administration.  
Anyone have a price quote/vendor for the vx to centris 650 upgrade? I've been quoted a price of $2401 till August 15th after which it will cost $2732.  This of course doesn't include the trade-in rebate of $1300 for the vx board.  Thus for $1101 one gets a Centris 650, 8 meg onboard with both the FPU and Ethernet.  Anyone else have any info? This price is from the University of Illinois micro-order center, are there any other vendors who offer similar prices? johann

Thanks to Bruce Barnett, who recommended xvttool, and Bernward Averwald and Liam Quin, who recommended modifying .Xdefaults to get the desired behavior for a *class* of xterms. In xvttool, simply create a key file that looks like: "a"	"A" "b"	"B" "c"	"C" ... and specify said key file on the command line.  This will translate any input into any other (in my case, lo-case to up-case).  Works great, and you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side. To use an xterm solution, add to your .Xdefaults: capxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \    ... or: capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\         ... and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm Thanks loads! --  Kevin Weinrich     Computer Sciences Corp.
Hello, I want a little network for 3 users. All users want to run Windows. The most important things I want for the network are: file-sharing, mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem card on one of the computers. We all want to use each others harddisk. My idea was to buy three computers (one 486DX and two 386DX). All three have a 40Mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large harddisk. All three also have a network card. The 486 is connected to the printers and contains the fax/modem card. And last but not least: Workgroups for Windows. My questions: - Is this possible? - What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups   for Windows? - Will all the computers be fast enough? Behind all three, someone   is working. Thanks, Martijn
I am wondering how to change the English fonts in an existed  API to some multi-bytes fonts ? (such as Chinese, Japanese...) Someone told me X11R5 supports some internationalization features, but I cannot find any examples for my need. Is there anybody has done some similar jobs ? By the way, all the English fonts should be replace by Chinese or Japanese fonts, that means in windows, menubar, button.... That will be great if someone can share us what you have done. Thanks in advance. M.C. Hung

Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify a color for drawing, like Drawpoint(x,y,color) or Drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or Fillrectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,color)  With X, I have to do something like  XSetForeground(current_color) XDrawPoint(d,w,x,y) Why split this into two functions? Why did X designers decide to not associate the color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the display it is being drawn on? Joseph Sirosh

Rather than write my own, can anyone direct me to a package that will let me create cascaded popup menus in X windows.  For reasons of portability, the package should  not rely on any X toolkit other than XLib and the XT Intrinsics.  Something written in C++ would be nice, too. Thanks
Answers please by e-mail, since not all groups in the header are carried here. Hi! Personally, I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a   burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better   than I like C++. But, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be   MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments   that come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid   prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want   to do real work. Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews   (what it is exactly, I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I   started with NeXTSTEP.)

Does anyone know if there are any problems (or if it's possible) adding a third hard drive(scsi) to a dos pc. I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2 Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed.  They work great, I haven't had any problems! Well, now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another (larger)  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors)   and   run the   fdisk   program   to format/initialize the disk. That didn't happen.  When the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the board[target 0/target1/target2].  All three disks are seen. When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, I choose to select another  disk(option  5(dos6)) and voila, it's not there. The first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is no-where to be found.... ARGH! Ideas anyone?????

It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?) issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both. But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low emissions" but not specifically "MPR-II Compliant" or "MPR-II Certified" only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other. 	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis- tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you may be more discerning.  Good luck! 					- Mitch (Oh yeah: I got my Hitachi Superscan 15 from Insight for $499.)

Another guy here was  using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver (the  default VGA for Windows).  He has an S3 LocalBus card like I do and when I  loaded the S3 video driver in Windows for him, his mouse became jumpy too.   Seems like it is the S3 driver!  Is there any newer one than version 1.4  that would solve this problem?  It is really bad.  I have to use the  keyboard instead sometimes!

   I am DESPERATELY trying to find a PC based e-mail wide area network service or the necessary network software to establish one myself. While I am aware there are various BBS's and other similar services avalible (like Compuserve, Canada Remote Systems etc.) I require fairly specific criteria. In  approximate order of importance they are: 1) The mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network    server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(NOTE: all users are remote    and will use modems over conventional phone lines.) 2) Simple. The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge    have never heard of Unix, and have very little interest in learning. It is    essential that the client software is completely pain-free. 3) Cheap. We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established    commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the    group - hence (1). In addition I would like the network server to be    something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486. (There are only about    40 people in the group, so it is not a huge network.) 4) The capability for Internet access (for news/mail).    If anyone knows of a system similar to what I am describing, even if it doesn't sastisfy all my criteria, and I don't care where it is, PLEASE PLEASE e-mail me and tell me about it. We are not adverse to making alterations to an existing system if necessary. Thanks.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) ===================================================================== I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system? 1. Free options 	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2. 	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will 	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86 	is listed below. 	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was 	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards. 	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4, 	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you 	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more). 	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below). 2. Commercial options      1) Metro Link 	2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it? 3. What is XFree86?    XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:     1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.    The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):     1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two        headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).        Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.    Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat. 4. What OSs are supported?     XFree86 supports: 	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2 	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC 	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2 	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1 	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active 	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet, 	but anyone should feel free to submit patches. 	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to 5. What video hardware is supported?    At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets: 	Tseng ET4000 	Tseng ET3000 	Paradise PVGA1 	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of 		the PVGA1, and use its driver) 	Genoa GVGA 	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000 	ATI 18800, 28800 	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, 	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in 	256 color mode. 	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of 	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the 	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome 	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k. 	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to 	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To 	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel 	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are 	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how 	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such 	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with 	future XFree86 releases. 	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86, 	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the 	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not 	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details. 	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond 	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions 	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). 	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it. 	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA 	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the 	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It 	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset 	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot 	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested 	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not 	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 	working fine on them. 6. What about accelerated boards? 	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards 	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available 	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4). 	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact 7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes? 	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory 	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- 	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each 	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame- 	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled 	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code 	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure). 	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer 	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this, 	but nothing is yet available from the project. 8. What other hardware or software requirements are there? 	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run 	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum. 	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending 	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). 	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will 	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable  	lower bound. 9. Where can I get source for XFree86? 	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22 	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from: 		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86) 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86) 		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86) 	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP) 	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information 	on which files you need to get to build your distribution. 10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86? 	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from: 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries 			under /XFree86/SVR4 		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/ISC 		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries 			under /pub/linux/packages/X11 		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries 			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries 			under /i386 	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may 	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will 	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take 	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were 	made when building the distribution. IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86? 11. Installation directories 	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot 	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include 	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}. 	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified 	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is 	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed 	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation. 12. Configuration files 	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup. 	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in 	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions. 13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes 	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings. 	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and 	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is 	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on 	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated 	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the 	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to 	David for inclusion in the database. 	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file  	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. 	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use 	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information 	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database. 	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and 	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot 	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from 	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The 	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. 	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your 	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up 	      starting the server in the future. 14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit 	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to 	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is 	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit. V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86? 	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755). 15. SVR4 	Why won't my xterm run properly? 	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define 	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run. 	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no' 	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping 	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be 	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap. 16. SVR3 	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running. 17. 386BSD 	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD. 	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey 	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites: 	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 18. Linux 	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc 	jump libraries installed. 	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root. 	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to 	run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes 	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files 	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the 	-pn argument to X386. 	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major 	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not 	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit 	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but 	startx won't. 	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with 	a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &". 	For more detailed information, please read the file README present 	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu. 19. Mach 	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach. VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source? 	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is 	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs. 	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86. VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86? 20. BSD compatibility library 	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc. 	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a 	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), 	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include 	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro 	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are 	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these 	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a 21. ANSICCOPTIONS 	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the 	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite 	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see 	something like 		CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings" 	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put 		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" 	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of 		ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi" 		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" 	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is: 		ANSICCOPTIONS= 	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death 	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because 	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must 	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition. XFree86 Contact Information     Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86     Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of: 	The original "gang of four": 	Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems: 	-------------------------------------------------- Thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates). --  Engineering Computing Facility      uucp:   uunet!utai!ecf!steve University of Toronto               phone:  (416) 978-5898

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course, I'm biased...) DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol, allowing you to display them, or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display on the net). Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform; many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or no modifications.

In fact, I'm looking for a possibility to connect different peaces of information (like in the windows help system).  And no, I don't want to program such a system by myself. The necessary effort and afford should be as small as possible. Thanx in advance,   Thomas!
